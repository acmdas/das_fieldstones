## Back Again
Sat, 21 Jan 2017

There was a time, years ago, when there were fairly frequent, short posts here, mostly of the TOTD (Thought of the Day) variety&mdash;pithy sayings, sentences or paragraphs gleaned from the day's Internet prowling or the evening's reading. Then the day came when I realized that, for the most part, those pithy sayings tended to be, well, possibly impolitic given the nature of my business arrangements (my primary client being the Federal Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, or CSAT, in essence not only Federal bureaucrats but almost entirely social workers). So, like a prudent if not courageous undercover something-or-other not at all progressive or even liberal (unless maybe Classical Liberal), I censored myself. Or, as Archie Bunker would say, "Stifle yerself!"

So, enough deep background. I see that I told this story in more detail just a few months ago <a href="http://www.consultingsmiths.com/why-add-to-a-blog-in-2016/## more-428" target="_blank">here</a> so have a look if you're interested. Today's point, and I do have one, is that FaceBook and I are having a partial parting of the ways. And this is to tell why.

First, the parting is partial because FB is still the only place to keep up with Grandkids and Great-Grandkids, particularly the ones in British Columbia. And other folks I give a damn about. So, I'll be checking in off and on, liking and saying nice things about other folks posts now and then. Just trying to not see too much and saying as little as I can. It's just too depressing&mdash;the alternative reality that a lot of my friends and family are living in isn't somewhere I want to visit.

So, to wrap this one up, I just might be putting stuff of interest, and even the occasional output from my fevered brain, here. We'll see.

## Twitter and Me and Very Strange Business Decisions
Sat, 21 Jan 2017

I had a Twitter account very early on. It's deleted now, and all the related emails that I've gotten from Twitter, so I'm not sure exactly when, but sometime in 2008. I "tweeted" maybe twice or three times before this summer, then I discovered <a href="http://thestrobist.com" target="_blank">The Strobist</a> site and got excited about moving beyond "available light" photography. The Strobist has an amazing amount of information, including detailed tutorials, on using off-camera flash. Great resource, strongly recommended, but this is about Twitter. Sort of.

David Hobby, aka "The Strobist", decided some time ago to disable comments and move all communications with his viewers to Twitter, so I got on board to thank him for his generosity, and to ask a few questions. He responded generously and quickly every time, and all was right with the world. Since I'm not an habitual Tweeter (twitterer?) that was it until last week, when I got Yet Another weekly email from Twitter telling me how much I was missing by not logging in and tweeting. It was a slow day (they almost all are now) and David and Joe McNally and some other folks whose names I didn't recognize were bemoaning the demise of everything good an bright in the world as we know it, or as we knew it, or something like that. And scrolling back, it had been like that pretty much since the election (yes, That election). Like on Facebook. Except I don't get any pictures of my Great Grandsons on Twitter. So I shit-canned it. Nuked from orbit. Over after all these years.

And, I do get that lots of folks really do believe the kinds of things that they're saying, that it's the attack of the Nazi Zombies from Mars or something and the end of all the goodness and sweetness from life. I get that, although I can't comprehend how they get there, or seriously believe that it's at all rational or sane.

What I don't get is people conflating the kind of talk that goes with this, implicitly or explicitly calling people who voted "the wrong way" Nazis or the like, with their business identity. How anyone who is the public face for their business or product, like David or Joe, who want people to pay to attend their photography training events, or actors or singers who want the public to attend their concerts or plays or movies, can feel at ease alienating half the American public? I'm not inclined to take part in boycotts at the drop of the hat&mdash;I am inclined to do things like eat more often at Chick-fil-a or buy from L. L. Bean if they are being shamed and boycotted for expressing an entirely normal opinion or supporting one or the other side in an election. I'm just like that.

I'll go back to The Strobist site and give him my pageviews, and buy from him anyway, but I don't feel the same about doing it that I did before. I very well might buy a ticket to a movie that Meryl Streep is in (although I just might stay away from a movie that Ashley Judd is in after seeing her performance at the Womens' March today) if it's Really Special, but it's going to have to be a Really Special one.

I may be the only person who feels this way, and if so, it won't mean anything to anybody's business. I couldn't afford to attend David or Joe's seminar in Dubai anyway, and I don't go to very many movies at all, and I'm not part of Beyonce's crew, or whatever, so they won't feel the loss. But it seems like they really don't care, and that's what I don't get.

## Just a Thought
Sun, 22 Jan 2017

Spent a minute looking through FaceBook, making sure that everyone I know who chose to exercise their freedom of assembly in the city today made it out okay, and posting a picture I took of my granddaughter Sophia playing her violin. It occurred to me how nice it is that so many people feel free to say really disrespectful, vulgar things about the President of the United States in a public setting without fear of being called "Racist" and possibly losing their jobs.
Just a thought.

## Septuagesima
Mon, 13 Feb 2017

&ldquo;It will be one of the confusions of the damned to see that they are condemned by their own reason, by which they claimed to condemn the Christian religion.&rdquo;&mdash;Pascal, PensÃ©e ## 562. 

&ldquo;A new species of philosopher is appearing; I venture to baptize these philosophers with a name not without danger in it. As I divine them, as they let themselves be divined&mdash;for it pertains to their nature to want to remain a riddle in some respects&mdash;these philosophers of the future, in many respects, might rightly, but perhaps also wrongly, be described as attempters. This name itself is in the end only an attempt, and, if you will, a temptation.&rdquo;&mdash;Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil, ## 42.

## The Head Comes Loose...
Mon, 13 Feb 2017

One character I think of&mdash;having known a long time&mdash;provides an especially poignant example. Long ago I suspected there was something wrong with him. He was &ldquo;on my side,&rdquo; but I could never trust him. And this because, he always thought ahead. &ldquo;He has more brains than he can handle,&rdquo; I once said of him. A very full head and a rather empty chest. He had no spiritual anchor, no faith beneath his clouds. His principles were mere thoughts: fluff passing over. Even his religious views were &ldquo;solidly pragmatic,&rdquo; i.e. easily revised. He could not understand even his own body, because he was all brain. His views were in a constant state of &ldquo;evolution&rdquo;: becoming ever more titched.

The head comes loose, when the heart is not screwed in.

## Truth to Power?
Tue, 14 Feb 2017

When you tell people what they want to hear, you don't have to be too careful about premises, facts, and conclusions.&mdash;Angelo M. Codevilla
What do we call those people in a society who are licensed or allowed to use violence? 

No hints this time. *We call these the people in charge*.&mdash;William M. Briggs

## Just to be clear...
Tue, 14 Feb 2017

Apropos all the recent fuss:
8 U.S.C. Â§ 1182(f), as currently posted by the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title8/html/USCODE-2011-title8-chap12-subchapII-partII-sec1182.htm" target="_blank">Government Printing Office</a> is the enabling statute (check it for yourself):

"(f) Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by President
Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate."

This is what is called "black letter law" and to this High School Graduate seems pretty straightforward, but I'd be pleased to listen to any argument to the contrary that doesn't smell like politics.

## Unintended Irony Department
Tue, 14 Feb 2017

Wikipedia has barred citations of The Daily Mail after editors of the online encyclopedia concluded Wednesday that the British tabloid is “generally unreliable.”

Of course, it's doubly ironic that some won't understand the irony...

## Heresy
Wed, 15 Feb 2017

"There are people who strictly deprive themselves of each and every eatable, drinkable and smokeable which has in any way acquired a shady reputation. They pay this price for health. And health is all they get for it. How strange it is. It is like paying out your whole fortune for a cow that has gone dry."&mdash;Mark Twain

"When they used to tell me I would shorten my life ten years by smoking, they little knew the devotee they were wasting their puerile word upon&mdash;they little knew how trivial and valueless I would regard a decade that had no smoking in it!"&mdash;Mark Twain

He is also known to have used Bad Words in his published works, which have been widely banned and declared Badthink. Memory hole material.

## Beware!
Wed, 15 Feb 2017

"Beware of manufacturing a God of your own, a God who is all mercy, but not just&mdash; a God who is all love, but not holy&mdash;a God who has a Heaven for everybody, but Hell for none&mdash;a God who can allow good and bad to be side by side in time, but will make no distinction between good and bad in eternity. Such a god is an idol of your own, as true an idol as was ever moulded out of brass or clay. The hands of your own fancy and sentimentality have made him. He is not the God of the Bible, and besides the God of the Bible there is no god at all."&mdash;The Right Reverand John C. Ryles, Bishop of Liverpool (1880-1900)

## Regard for Power
Thu, 16 Feb 2017

"Somewhere in *The Power Broker* I write that regard for power means disregard of those without power. I mean, we're really talking about justice and injustice."&mdash;Robert Caro

I found a wonderful <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6442/robert-caro-the-art-of-biography-no-5-robert-caro" target="_blank">interview with author Robert Caro</a> on the Paris Review site about "The Art of Biography"&mdash;linked to, from all places, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Hacker News</a>! That's the WWW, good stuff is where you find it. I love surprises.

## Illegitimi non carborundum
Fri, 17 Feb 2017

I've been gradually working my way through all of the Heinlein corpus, and a year or so back I ran across his list of "things every adult should know" and one that I wasn't close on was a foreign language. I'm confident that my two years of High School Spanish wouldn't cut the mustard. So, I chose Latin.

It's been slow slogging, mainly due to distractions and inertia, but I'm making a little progress, so I thought that I should have been able to make more sense of "illegitimi non carborundum" than I did. "Illegitimi" and "non" were easy, but "carborundum" while familiar as a brand name didn't appear in any form in any of the Latin dictionaries or word lists that I could find.

Google saved the day&mdash;it's a joke, and one apropos today for any of us old-fashioned folk. 
"Don't let the bastards grind you down."

## Why Become a Journalist?
Sat, 18 Feb 2017

"I became a journalist partly so that I wouldn't ever have to depend on the press for my information."&mdash;Christopher Hitchens

## The Enlightenment contra Grace
Sat, 18 Feb 2017

&ldquo;The Enlightenment is always wrong, because its ultimate goal is to *expose*. Grace, by contrast, is founded on truth, because it covers a multitude of sins. What God once and for all does not wish to know should never become the object of human knowledge and investigation.&rdquo;&mdash;Hans Urs von Balthasar

## Polluted Vehicles
Sun, 19 Feb 2017

"Nothing can be believed which is seen in a newspaper. Truth itself becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle."&mdash;Thomas Jefferson to John Norvell, 14 June 1807

Quoted today by the President at a rally in Melbourne, Florida.

## Miracles (again)
Mon, 20 Feb 2017

&ldquo;And I dare say the first time you saw a man raised from the dead you might think so too.&rdquo; He giggled unconvincingly behind the smiling mask. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s funny, isn&rsquo;t it? It isn&rsquo;t a case of miracles not happening&mdash;it&rsquo;s just a case of people calling them something else. Can&rsquo;t you see the doctors round the dead man? He isn&rsquo;t breathing any more, his pulse has stopped, his heart&rsquo;s not beating: he&rsquo;s dead. The somebody gives him back his life, and they all&mdash;what&rsquo;s the expression?&mdash;reserve their opinion. They won&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s a miracle, because that&rsquo;s a word they don&rsquo;t like. Then it happens again and again perhaps&mdash;because God&rsquo;s about on earth&mdash;and they say: these aren&rsquo;t miracles, it is simply that we have enlarged our conception of what life is. Now we know you can be alive without pulse, breath, heart-beats. And they invent a new word to describe that state of life, and they say science has disproved a miracle.&rdquo; He giggled again. &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t get round them.&rdquo;"&mdash;Graham Greene *The Power and the Glory*

## History and Leaves
Thu, 09 Mar 2017

If you don't know history, then you don't know anything. You are a leaf that doesn't know it is part of a tree. &rdquo;• Michael Crichton

## Luna
Wed, 15 Mar 2017

"The Moon is not a destination&mdash;it is a direction."&ndash;Mike Collins, astronaut

## Simply Because It&#039;s Amusing
Thu, 16 Mar 2017

"Certain magazines have symposiums (I will call them &lsquo;symposia&rdquo; if I am allowed to call the two separate South Kensington collections &lsquo;musea&rdquo;)" &ndash; G. K. Chesterton

Amusing because it pokes at one of my own peccadilloes. Saying "peccadilloes" rather than "bad habits" deserves another clever poke at the same personal weakness, but it's too early and I've had too little coffee.

## Straw Men
Fri, 21 Apr 2017

"Nothing burns as brightly as a straw man."&mdash;William M. Briggs (in re: those who are "against science")

## Free Press vs. Official Press
Thu, 04 May 2017

"WHEREVER I go, my first object, if I wish to find out the truth, is to get hold of the Free Press in France as in England, and even in America. But I know that wherever I get hold of such an organ it will be very strongly coloured with the opinion, or even fanaticism, of some minority. The Free Press, as a whole, if you add it all up and cancel out one exaggerated statement against another, does give you a true view of the state of society in which you live. The Official Press to-day gives you an absurdly false one everywhere. What a caricature&mdash;and what a base, empty caricature&mdash;of England or France or Italy you get in the "Times," or the "Manchester Guardian," the "Matin," or the "Tribune"! No one of them is in any sense general&mdash;or really national."&mdash;Hilaire Belloc: *The Free Press*, XI, B.

## Am I a Bad Person?
Fri, 05 May 2017

Just stopped into FB to post a silly picture. Couldn't help seeing the "Christians help the poor" and "If you don't love Obamacare you're a monster" pictures.

Almost posted something like "Somehow I can't make the leap from 'Christians should care for the sick and hungry' to 'Christians should make it illegal for other people to not give the Government their money to care for the sick and hungry" but I resisted the temptation (and avoided the firestorm).

Am I a bad person?

## A Sharp Moment of Revelation
Fri, 05 May 2017

&ldquo;ALL you that feel youth slipping past you and that are desolate at the approach of age, be merry; it is not what it looks like from in front and from outside. There is a glory in all completion, and all good endings are but shining transitions. There will come a sharp moment of revelation when you shall bless the effect of time&rdquo;¦ All you that have loved passionately and have torn your hearts asunder in disillusions, do not imagine that things broken cannot be mended by the good angels.&rdquo;&mdash;Hilaire Belloc: The Path to Rome.

## Censorship &#8211; Come meet the new boss...
Tue, 09 May 2017

...the same as the old boss.

* "AT present, it is not we that silence the Press; it is the Press that silencens us. It is not a case of the Commonwealth settling how much the editors shall say; it is a case of the editors settling how much the Commonwealth shall know." (Illustrated London News, Oct. 19, 1907)

* "BUT the modern editor regards himself far too much as a kind of original artist, who can select and suppress facts with the arbitrary ease of a poet or a caricaturist." (ILN, Oct. 26, 1907)

* "THE frivolous chatter is now all in public journalism." (ILN, Feb. 1908)

* "THERE is no fear that a modern king will attempt to override the constitution: it is more likely that he will ignore the constitution and work behind its back. He will take no advantage of his kingly power: it is more likely that he will take advantage of his kingly powerlessness -- of the fact that he is free from criticism and publicity. For the King is the most private person of our time. It will not be necessary for anyone to fight against the proposal of a censorship of the Press. We do not need a censorship of the Press. We have a censorship by the Press." (Orthodoxy, 1908)

* "THE new method of journalism is to offer so many comments or, at least, secondary circumstances that there is actually no room left for the original facts." (ILN, Nov. 6, 1909)

* "IT is by this time practically quite impossible to get the truth out of newspapers, even the honest newspapers." (ILN, Jan. 23, 1909)

* "AND the papers are shouting louder and louder like demagogues, merely because their hearers are growing more and more deaf." (ILN, Dec. 8, 1928)

* "WHAT I protest against is the prevailing fashion, in the Press and elsewhere, of parading all this perfectly natural indifference and ignorance as if it were a sort of impartiality." (ILN, Apr. 12, 1930)
~G.K. Chesterton

## The Best Words
Fri, 12 May 2017

"Short words are best and the old words when short are best of all."&mdash;Winston Churchill

## Needles
Fri, 12 May 2017

"Frankly, I don't think you could have driven a needle up my sphincter using a sledgehammer."&mdash;Col. Barry Horne, F-117 pilot, on first mission over Baghdad

## Secrecy
Fri, 12 May 2017

"The very word "secrecy" is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it."&mdash;John F. Kennedy

## A little good sense
Fri, 12 May 2017

"It is said that there is a technical term for people who believe that little boys and little girls are born indistinguishable and are molded into their natures by parental socialization. The term is 'childless.'"&mdash;Steven Pinker

## It&#039;s not my problem...
Fri, 12 May 2017

But what if it was?

What if the apparently intractable cultural issues that you take for granted were instead seen as problems on your desk, things you could influence?

What if the rules others take for granted are seen by you and your team as standards you can change?

What if we take the responsibility instead of waiting for it to be offered?

## The Danger of Books
Fri, 12 May 2017

"Directly above my head on the glass-topped coffee table are Doris's favorite books just as she left them...

*Siddhartha*

*Atlas Shrugged*

*ESP and the New Spirituality*

"Books matter. My poor wife, Doris, was ruined by books..., not by dirty books, but by clean books, not by depraved books but by spiritual books. God, if you recall, did not warn his people against dirty books. He warned them against high places. My wife, who began life as a cheerful Episcopalian from Virginia, became a priestess of the high places...But books ruined her. Beware of Episcopal women who take up with Ayn Rand and the Buddha...A certain type of Episcopal girl has a weakness that comes on them just past youth, just as sure as Italian girls get fat. They fall prey to Gnostic pride, commence buying antiques, and develop a yearning for esoteric doctrine."&mdash;Walker Percy: <i>Love in the Ruins</i>

## Men Have Forgotten God
Wed, 17 May 2017

More than half a century ago, while I was still a child, I recall hearing a number of older people offer the following explanation for the great disasters that had befallen Russia: Men have forgotten God; that's why all this has happened.

Since then I have spent well-nigh fifty years working on the history of our Revolution; in the process I have read hundreds of books, collected hundreds of personal testimonies, and have already contributed eight volumes of my own toward the effort of clearing away the rubble left by that upheaval. But if I were asked today to formulate as concisely as possible the main cause of the ruinous Revolution that swallowed up some sixty million of our people, I could not put it more accurately than to repeat: Men have forgotten God; that's why all this has happened.

What is more, the events of the Russian Revolution can only be understood now, at the end of the century, against the background of what has since occurred in the rest of the world. What emerges here is a process of universal significance. And if I were called upon to identify briefly the principal trait of the entire twentieth century, here too, I would be unable to find anything more precise and pithy than to repeat once again: Men have forgotten God.&mdash;<a href="http://www.roca.org/OA/36/36h.htm" target="_blank">Alexander Solzhenitsyn</a>

## Cold Civil War
Thu, 18 May 2017

"Much of the heat in contemporary American politics comes from the attempt, principally from the Left but increasingly from the Right as well, to force the entire nation to live in precisely the same way with precisely the same values. Statesmanship should begin by questioning and moderating that tendency."&mdash;<a href="http://www.claremont.org/crb/article/the-cold-civil-war/" target="_blank">Angelo M. Codevilla</a>

## Let Them Paste Passwords!
Thu, 18 May 2017

The British NCSC agrees with yours truly that those websites who prevent you, me and everyone else from pasting passwords (or using browser plug-ins that do it for us) in the name of "security" are in fact undermining security. I'm not always a fan of NCSC, but on this one they're 100% right on.

## If You Don&#039;t Read Books
Wed, 24 May 2017

"...the most suggestive thing I saw in America the past 18 months I actually think of an item in a hotel gift shop in southern Florida.  It was a decorative kitchen towel, I think made locally.  It bore these words:   'America, 2016.'  Below that it said, 'Once we had Steve Jobs, Johnny Cash and Bob Hope.  Now they're gone, and we're outta jobs, outta cash and outta hope.  And below that it said, "Please Kevin Bacon, don't die."" -- Peggy Noonan, at the <a href="https://www.cua.edu/speeches-and-homilies/2017/commencement-2017.html" target="_blank">Catholic University Commencement</a>
Clever line, but what's it got to do with reading? Well, follow the link and read the rest of her remarks&mdash;it's worth it!

## Otherworldly Twits
Fri, 26 May 2017

"Do you wonder why the legacy media are such puzzled otherworldly twits? Why, for example, they had no idea what was happening in the recent election? Why they seem to know so very little about America or much of anything else?
"Some thoughts from a guy who spent a career in the racket:

"Ask journalists when they were last in a truck stop on an Interstate, last in Boone, North Carolina or Barstow, California or any of thousands of such towns across the country. Ask whether they were in the military, whether they have ever talked to a cop or an ambulance crewman or a fireman. Ask whether they have a Mexican friend, when they last ate in a restaurant where a majority of the customers were black.  Whether they know an enlisted man, or anyone in the armed services. Whether they have hitchhiked overnight, baited a hook, hunted, or fired a rifle. Whether they have ever worked washing dishes, harvesting crops, driving a delivery truck. Whether they have a blue-collar friend. Know what the Texas Two-Step is, have been in a biker bar.

## More Reed on today&#039;s reporters
Fri, 26 May 2017

"Journalists are not stupid, running to well above average in intelligence. You could form a large chapter of Mensa by raiding newsrooms in Washington. However, with a fair few exceptions, they are not intellectuals, not contemplative, not studious. They are high-pressure fact-accountants, competitive, comfortable under tight deadlines, aggressive, combative, quick but shallow. This can be a serviceable substituent for stupid."&mdash;<a href="https://fredoneverything.org/notes-of-a-reformed-news-weasel-understanding-the-vacuity/" target="_blank">Fred Reed</a>

&ldquo;we&rsquo;re not living in a two-story house with us on the bottom floor and God upstairs and that&rsquo;s it.

## Unthinkable?
Sat, 27 May 2017

"IN a word, the world does not explain itself, and cannot do so merely by continuing to expand itself. But anyhow it is absurd for the Evolutionist to complain that it is unthinkable for an admittedly unthinkable God to make everything out of nothing and then pretend that it is more thinkable that nothing should turn itself into everything."&mdash;G.K. Chesterton: St. Thomas Aquinas, Chap. VIIâ”€The Permanent Philosophy.


## Elections Matter
Sun, 28 May 2017

&ldquo;We have always known that eternal vigilance is the price of freedom. It&rsquo;s worse now, because capture of government is so much more important than it once was. There was a time when there was enough freedom that it hardly mattered which brand of crooks ran government. That has not been true for a long time&mdash;not during most of your lifetimes, and for much of mine&mdash;and it will probably never be true again.&rdquo;&mdash;Jerry Pournelle

Tue, 06 Jun 2017

&ldquo;We make men without chests and expect from them virtue and enterprise. We laugh at honor and are shocked to find traitors in our midst.&rdquo;&mdash;C. S. Lewis

## Heresy
Thu, 08 Jun 2017

"But there is one thing that is infinitely more absurd and unpractical than burning a man for his philosophy. This is the habit of saying that his philosophy does not matter, and this is done universally in the twentieth century, in the decadence of the great revolutionary period."&mdash;G. K. Chesterton, "Heretics"

## A Great Man
Thu, 08 Jun 2017

"Whatever the word 'great' means, Dickens was what it means. Even the fastidious and unhappy who cannot read his books without a continuous critical exasperation, would use the word of him without stopping to think."&mdash;G. K. Chesterton, *Charles Dickens*

## Adversus Haereses
Thu, 08 Jun 2017

"It would be futile to make a sketch of St. Thomas and conceal the fact that he fought with heretics; and yet the fact itself may embarrass the very purpose for which it is employed. I can only express the hope, and indeed the confidence, that those who regard me as the heretic will hardly blame me for expressing my own convictions, and certainly not for expressing my hero's convictions. There is only one point upon which such a question concerns this very simple narrative. It is the conviction, which I have expressed once or twice in the course of it, that the sixteenth-century schism was really a belated revolt of the thirteenth-century pessimists. It was a back-wash of the old Augustinian Puritanism against the Aristotelian liberality. Without that, I could not place my historical figure in history."&mdash;G. K. Chesterton *Saint Thomas Aquinas&mdash;the Dumb Ox*

## In Your Philosophy, Horatio
Sun, 11 Jun 2017

"There can be no doubt that there is an essential relation between Christian revelation and certain fundamental natural truths. The existence of objective truth, the spiritual reality of the person, the difference between soul and body, the objectivity of moral good and evil, the freedom of the will, the immortality of the soul, the existence of a personal God&mdash;all are implied by Christian revelation. Every word in the New Testament clearly presupposes these elementary truths. And any philosophy that denies them can never be accepted or tolerated by the Church."&mdash;Deitrich von Hildebrand, *Trojan Horse in the City of God* (p. 62)

## Contagion
Fri, 23 Jun 2017

"There is nothing so contagious as holiness, nothing more pervasive than Prayer. This is precisely what the traditional Church means by evangelism and what distinguishes it from recruitment."&mdash;Fr. Martin Thornton, *Pastoral Theology: A Reorientation*

## Belief
Sat, 24 Jun 2017

"I have heard it confidently stated, for instance, that the American troops had been brought to Europe not to fight the Germans but to crush an English revolution. One has to belong to the intelligentsia to believe things like that: no ordinary man could be such a fool."&mdash;George Orwell, *<a href="http://orwell.ru/library/essays/nationalism/english/e_nat" target="_blank">Notes on Nationalism</a>*

## Fantasies
Sun, 25 Jun 2017

"We say that it is in believing ages that you get men living in the open and dancing and telling tales by the fire. We say that it is in ages of unbelief, that you get emperors dressing up as women, and gladiators, or minor poets wearing green carnations and praising unnameable things. We say that, taking ages as a whole, the wildest fantasies of superstition are nothing to the fantasies of rationalism."&mdash;G. K. Chesterton, *God and my Neighbour*

## Respect and Fidelity
Sun, 25 Jun 2017

"Today, certainly it is important for us to show that same respect and fidelity to the Word of God, so as not to manipulate it to fit historical, political, or ideological circumstances, for the purpose of pleasing men and acquiring a reputation as a scholar or avant-garde theologian.Â .Â .Â . As Saint Paul says, 'We are not like so many [who] practice cunning or.Â .Â . tamper with God&rsquo;s word' (cf. 2 Cor 2:17; 4:2)."&mdash;Cardinal Robert Sarah, *God or Nothing*

## The Pagan Ideal
Sun, 25 Jun 2017

"My objection to Mr. Lowes Dickinson and the reassertors of the pagan ideal is, then, this. I accuse them of ignoring definite human discoveries in the moral world, discoveries as definite, though not as material, as the discovery of the circulation of the blood. We cannot go back to an ideal of reason and sanity. For mankind has discovered that reason does not lead to sanity. We cannot go back to an ideal of pride and enjoyment. For mankind has discovered that pride does not lead to enjoyment. I do not know by what extraordinary mental accident modern writers so constantly connect the idea of progress with the idea of independent thinking. Progress is obviously the antithesis of independent thinking. For under independent or individualistic thinking, every man starts at the beginning, and goes, in all probability, just as far as his father before him. But if there really be anything of the nature of progress, it must mean, above all things, the careful study and assumption of the whole of the past. I accuse Mr. Lowes Dickinson and his school of reaction in the only real sense. If he likes, let him ignore these great historic mysteries&mdash;the mystery of charity, the mystery of chivalry, the mystery of faith. If he likes, let him ignore the plough or the printing-press. But if we do revive and pursue the pagan ideal of a simple and rational self-completion we shall end&mdash;where Paganism ended. I do not mean that we shall end in destruction. I mean that we shall end in Christianity."&mdash;G. K. Chesterton, <a href="https://www.ccel.org/ccel/chesterton/heretics.xii.html" target="_blank">*Heretics*</a>

## The Virtue of Toleration
Tue, 27 Jun 2017

&ldquo;There was a confused liberal notion that toleration was in some way a virtue in itself.&rdquo;&mdash;Hilaire Belloc, *Essays of a Catholic*

## In Which Case...
Fri, 30 Jun 2017

"You can spend your own money on yourself in which case quality and price are paramount. You can spend your money on others in which case price is paramount and quality less so. You can spend others' money on you in which case you will have a fine lunch. Or you can spend other peoples money on other people in which case you have government."&mdash;Milton Friedman

## Political Ideals
Mon, 03 Jul 2017

&ldquo;Political ideals will vary according to men&rsquo;s views on human destiny. Those who are persuaded that the purpose of life is pleasure, or power, or honour, will reckon that State best arranged in which they can live comfortably, or acquire great wealth, or achieve great power and lord it over many. Others who think that the crowning good of virtue is the purpose of our present life will want an arrangement under which men can live virtuously and peaceably together. In short, political judgment will be settled by the sort of life a man expects and proposes to lead by living in a community.&rdquo;&mdash;St. Thomas Aquinas: Commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s &lsquo;Politics,&rdquo; Book II, lect. 1.

## No New Thing
Wed, 05 Jul 2017

"To say that the present is a time of change and upheaval, social, political and religious, is to state a truism so obvious as to invite ironic contradiction.  The cataclysm through which we are passing is at once so vast in its dimensions and so profound in its penetration of individual life, that we may well shrink from looking to history for guidance on circumstances to which history itself affords no parallel.  Yet it is no new thing for the established manners, customs and beliefs of men to be upset.  In all such times of violent transition the same great problem of the reconciliation between old and new forces itself upon the judgement of mankind, and it should not be impossible to find in the lesser crises of the past principles of thought and action which may help us to deal with the gigantic perplexities of today."&mdash;Oliver Chase Quick, *Essays in Orthodoxy* 1916

## The Riddle of Life
Thu, 06 Jul 2017

"The riddle of life is simply this. For some mad reason in this mad world of ours, the things which men differ about most are exactly the things about which they must be got to agree. Men can agree on the fact that the earth goes round the sun. But then it does not matter a dump whether the earth goes around the sun or the Pleiades. But men cannot agree about morals: sex, property, individual rights, fixity and contracts, patriotism, suicide, public habits of health&mdash;these are exactly the things that men tend to fight about. And these are exactly the things that must be settled somehow on strict principles. Study each of them, and you will find each of them works back certainly to a philosophy, probably to a religion."&mdash;G. K. Chesterton, *The Victorian Age*

## The Safety of Antiquity
Fri, 07 Jul 2017

"What, then, shall a Catholic Christian do, if some small part of the Church cut itself off from the communion of the universal faith?  What else but prefer the health of the whole body before the pestiferous and corrupt member? What if some new infection goeth about to corrupt, not in this case only a little part, but the whole Church? Then, likewise, shall he regard, and be sure to cleave unto Antiquity; which can now no more be seduced by any crafty novelty."&mdash;Vincentius of Lerin. *The Doctrine of the Fathers*

## Paranoia
Wed, 12 Jul 2017

I'm sorry, I just can't help myself...
I'm so old, I can remember when it was conservatives who saw Russians under every bed.
There, I said it.

## Religious Truth
Mon, 17 Jul 2017

"Men despise religion; they hate it and are afraid it is true."&mdash;Blaise Pascal

## Secularization of Christianity
Mon, 17 Jul 2017

"The conclusion to which I have found myself forced is twofold: first that what we are being offered [secularization, ed.] is not a reinterpretation of the Christian religion but a substitute for it, and secondly that the arguments offered, from whichever field of study they have been drawn, are quite unconvincing."&mdash;E. L. Mascall

## Lost Trust
Mon, 17 Jul 2017

"Instead of asking themselves why they lost people&rsquo;s trust, the media instead asked why the people had lost trust in them. A subtle, but important difference."&mdash;Milo Yiannopoulos

## Gone 64 Years

## The Gods of the Copybook Headings
Mon, 24 Jul 2017

The Gods of the Copybook Headings

by Rudyard Kipling

AS I PASS through my incarnations in every age and race,
I make my proper prostrations to the Gods of the Market Place.
Peering through reverent fingers I watch them flourish and fall,
And the Gods of the Copybook Headings, I notice, outlast them all.

We were living in trees when they met us. They showed us each in turn
That Water would certainly wet us, as Fire would certainly burn:
But we found them lacking in Uplift, Vision and Breadth of Mind,
So we left them to teach the Gorillas while we followed the March of Mankind.

We moved as the Spirit listed. They never altered their pace,
Being neither cloud nor wind-borne like the Gods of the Market Place,
But they always caught up with our progress, and presently word would come
That a tribe had been wiped off its icefield, or the lights had gone out in Rome.

With the Hopes that our World is built on they were utterly out of touch,
They denied that the Moon was Stilton; they denied she was even Dutch;
They denied that Wishes were Horses; they denied that a Pig had Wings;
So we worshipped the Gods of the Market Who promised these beautiful things.

When the Cambrian measures were forming, They promised perpetual peace.
They swore, if we gave them our weapons, that the wars of the tribes would cease.
But when we disarmed They sold us and delivered us bound to our foe,
And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: "*Stick to the Devil you know*." 

On the first Feminian Sandstones we were promised the Fuller Life
(Which started by loving our neighbour and ended by loving his wife)
Till our women had no more children and the men lost reason and faith,
And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: "*The Wages of Sin is Death*." 

In the Carboniferous Epoch we were promised abundance for all, 
By robbing selected Peter to pay for collective Paul; 
But, though we had plenty of money, there was nothing our money could buy, 
And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: "*If you don't work you die*." 

Then the Gods of the Market tumbled, and their smooth-tongued wizards withdrew
And the hearts of the meanest were humbled and began to believe it was true
That All is not Gold that Glitters, and Two and Two make Four
And the Gods of the Copybook Headings limped up to explain it once more.

As it will be in the future, it was at the birth of Man
There are only four things certain since Social Progress began. 
That the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her Mire, 
And the burnt Fool's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire;

And that after this is accomplished, and the brave new world begins
When all men are paid for existing and no man must pay for his sins, 
As surely as Water will wet us, as surely as Fire will burn, 
The Gods of the Copybook Headings with terror and slaughter return!

## See No Evil
Mon, 24 Jul 2017

"Why am I telling you all this? Because I fear that, except for a few of us remaining graybeards and some immigrants from the world&rsquo;s manifold tyrannies and anarchies, most Americans are too young to remember, even vicariously, the ills that the world can inflict and the effort it takes to withstand and restrain them. They have studied no history, so not only can they not distinguish Napoleon from Hitler, but also they have no conception of how many ills mankind has suffered or inflicted on itself and how heroic has been the effort of the great, the wise, and the good over the centuries to advance the world&rsquo;s enlightenment and civilization&mdash;efforts that the young have learned to scorn as the self-interested machinations of dead white men to maintain their dominance. While young people are examining their belly buttons for microaggressions, real evil still haunts the world, still inheres in human nature; and those who don&rsquo;t know this are at risk of being ambushed and crushed by it."&mdash;Myron Magnet in [The City Journal](https://www.city-journal.org/html/see-no-evil-15330.html)

## On the D-Word
Mon, 24 Jul 2017

"The part of Christian teaching that is most obscure to contemporary Christians and pseudos is the frequent reference in the Gospels to Demons, and Demonic inhabitation. Christ is Himself the source of this curiously unmodern &ldquo;point of view.&rdquo; Then Paul carries it the further nine yards. If you haven&rsquo;t noticed this, you weren&rsquo;t reading carefully enough. (Or maybe you haven&rsquo;t read it at all?)"&mdash;[David Warren](http://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2017/07/24/on-the-d-word/)

## The Answer
Wed, 09 Aug 2017

&ldquo;People ask me what advice I have for a married couple struggling in their relationship. I always answer, &ldquo;Pray and forgive&rdquo;; and to young people who come from violent homes, &ldquo;Pray and forgive&rdquo;; and to the single mother with no family support, &ldquo;Pray and forgive.&rdquo; You can say, &ldquo;My Lord, I love You. My God, I am sorry. My God, I believe in You. My God, I trust You. Help us to love one an other as You love us.&rdquo;&mdash;Mother Teresa, A Simple Path

## Acceptance
Thu, 10 Aug 2017

"Do not accept anything as the truth if it lacks love. And do not accept anything as love if it lacks the truth."&mdash;St. Teresa Benedicta of the Cross

## Our task...
Mon, 14 Aug 2017

"Men, a species that includes bishops, are left with a certain radical freedom, which constant intervention by the Deity would cancel. We have been already provided with what we need to know in the Deposit of Faith. There is nothing that Christ absent-mindedly forgot to tell us. Our task is not to supply what he overlooked or failed to anticipate, or to &ldquo;update&rdquo; the teaching for a human condition which does not, itself, change. Nor is it to murkily redefine terms long since clarified. Neither popes nor bishops are above that Revelation."&mdash;<a href="http://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2015/10/04/fact-mystery/" target="_blank">David Warren</a>

## Seditious and Tyrannical
Sat, 26 Aug 2017

"It seems to me that at a deep level, 'democracy' can be criticized for its intention: to replace the sometimes inscrutable judgement of God with the too-scrutable judgement of humans. Or to put this more plainly: it is seditious and tyrannical, both, from the start. Its effect can be seen from this cause: for we are all atheists today, insofar as we are enfranchised; all fully 'secularized' in the public square."&mdash;<a href="http://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2017/08/26/war-famine-plague-sedition/" target="_blank">David Warren</a> once again.

## The Most Well-Known Amount of People
Sat, 26 Aug 2017

Okay, time for a little "David admits his prejudices" post.
Apparently you can get a journalism (or it is "Communications" now) degree without reading Strunk and White? And you can publish articles without any perusal by an editor who has read Strunk and White? That has to be the case when foolishness like "amount of people" rather than "number of people" or "most well-known" instead of "best known" appears over and over and over again.
These are Heinlein's Crazy Years, we just live in them!

## When not being angry is a sin...
Wed, 30 Aug 2017

"He who is not angry when he has cause to be, sins. For unreasonable patience is a hotbed of many vices."&mdash;St. John Chrysostom (Homily 11)

## Thought out thought
Sun, 03 Sep 2017

"PHILOSOPHY is merely thought that has been thought out. It is often a great bore. But man has no alternative, except between being influenced by thought that has been thought out and being influenced by thought that has not been thought out. The latter is what we commonly call culture and enlightenment today."&mdash;G.K. Chesterton: *The Revival of Philosophy&mdash;Why?*

## Truth and Error
Fri, 08 Sep 2017

"It is as much a crime to disturb the peace when truth prevails as it is a crime to keep the peace when truth is violated. There is therefore a time in which peace is justified and a time when it is not justifiable. For it is written that there is a time for peace and a time for war and it is the law of truth that distinguishes the two. But at no time is there a time for truth and a time for error, for it is written that God's truth shall abide forever. That is why Christ has said that He has come to bring peace and at the same time that He has come to bring the sword. But He does not say that He has come to bring both the truth and the falsehood."&mdash;Blaise Pascal

## Democracy&#039;s Fruits
Fri, 08 Sep 2017

"If you establish a democracy, you must in due time reap the fruits of a democracy. You will in due season have great impatience of public burdens, combined in due season with great increase of public expenditure. You will in due season have wars entered into from passion and not from reason."&mdash;Benjamin Disraeli

## Correcting is Judging
Sun, 10 Sep 2017

"We live in times in which there is a widespread notion that to correct sinners is to &ldquo;judge&rdquo; them. Never mind that it is sin that we judge, not the sinner. Never mind that in accusing us of judging, the worldly-minded are themselves doing the very judging they condemn. Never mind any of that; the point of the charge is to try to shame us into silence. Despite the fact that Scripture consistently directs us to correct the sinner, many Catholics have bought into the notion that correcting the sinner is &ldquo;judging&rdquo; him. In this, the devil, who orchestrates the &ldquo;correcting is judging&rdquo; campaign, rejoices; for if he can keep us from correcting one another, sin can and does flourish."&mdash;<a href="http://blog.adw.org/2017/09/obligation-clear-compassionate-correction-sinner-homily-23rd-sunday-year/" target="_blank">Msgr.

## Facing the Future on the Downside of the Liberal Revolution
Thu, 14 Sep 2017

"When everything that smacks of the transcendent is eliminated from the public life of a culture, something has to take its place. In our case it is largely commerce and the ideals and ideas that commerce fosters. Moreover, the liberty that accompanies such a commercial society is a liberty whose chief effect is the dissolving of traditional ties and the destruction of traditional communities, whether that takes place because of direct attacks on the family and chastity or indirectly because of an economic system that works as a solvent in hundreds of ways: driving mothers out of the home, exploiting sex to sell products, moving families about to seek employment, or emptying rural areas of farm families."&mdash;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Christendom-Americanism-Beyond-Jagged-Postmodern-ebook/dp/B01EJ0OQ92/ref=la_B001K7S392_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1505417861&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Thomas Storck</a>

## Atheist for a Day
Tue, 19 Sep 2017

"Often even fully catechized Christians act from unbelief. For the man who succumbs to a terrible temptation is playing atheist for the day. He might think himself Christian on other days, when there are no significant temptations. But he is fooling himself. For God IS watching."&mdash;<a href="https://www.thecatholicthing.org/2017/09/15/back-to-nature-2/" target="_blank">David Warren</a>

## Work and Pray
Tue, 19 Sep 2017

"Work as if everything depended on you; pray as if everything depended on God."
Attr. to St. Augustine. Also to St. Ignatius of Loyola. And to Martin Luther.

## Why?
Fri, 22 Sep 2017

 &lsquo;Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others ; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness: only power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from all the oligarchies of the past, in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now do you begin to understand me?&rdquo;&mdash;George Orwell&mdash;*1984* O'Brien to Winston

## Tails
Fri, 22 Sep 2017

&ldquo;If you call a tail a leg, how many legs would a dog have? 
Four, because, even if you call it a leg, it&rsquo;s still a tail.&rdquo;&mdash;Abraham Lincoln

## Empathy for the Grieving
Sat, 07 Oct 2017

"The truest act of empathy for the grieving is to pray for the dead."&mdash;<a href="http://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2017/10/03/against-closure/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">David Warren</a>

## Rules, or maybe, Intelligence

"We learn from history that we learn nothing from history."&mdash;G. B. Shaw

## Schism and Heresy
Fri, 13 Oct 2017

"Heresy and schism are distinguished in respect of those things to which each is opposed essentially and directly. For heresy is essentially opposed to faith, while schism is essentially opposed to the unity of ecclesiastical charity. Wherefore just as faith and charity are different virtues, although whoever lacks faith lacks charity, so too schism and heresy are different vices, although whoever is a heretic is also a schismatic, but not conversely. This is what Jerome says in his commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians [In Ep. ad Tit. iii, 10]: "I consider the difference between schism and heresy to be that heresy holds false doctrine while schism severs a man from the Church." Nevertheless, just as the loss of charity is the road to the loss of faith, according to 1 Timothy 1:6: "From which things," i.e. charity and the like, "some going astray, are turned aside into vain babbling," so too, schism is the road to heresy. Wherefore Jerome adds (In Ep. ad Tit. iii, 10) that "at the outset it is possible, in a certain respect, to find a difference between schism and heresy: yet there is no schism that does not devise some heresy for itself, that it may appear to have had a reason for separating from the Church."&mdash;St. Thomas Aquinas: <a href="http://newadvent.org/summa/3039.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Summa Theologica</a>, II-II, q. 39, a. 1, ad 3

## Society is Dissolving
Fri, 13 Oct 2017

"Cultures spring from religions; ultimately the vital force which maintains any culture is its philosophy, its attitude toward the universe; the decay of a religion involves the decay of the culture corresponding to it&mdash;we see that most clearly in the breakdown of Christendom today. The bad work begun at the Reformation is bearing its final fruit in the dissolution of our ancestral doctrines&mdash;the very structure of our society is dissolving."&mdash;Hilaire Belloc: <a href="https://oldthunderbelloc.blogspot.com/2015/05/the-great-heresies.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Great Heresies</a>, Chap. III

## On Heresy
Fri, 13 Oct 2017

&ldquo;Therefore, heresy is so called from the Greek word meaning &lsquo;choice,&rdquo; by which each chooses according to his own will what he pleases to teach or believe. But we are not permitted to believe whatever we choose, nor to choose whatever someone else has believed. We have the apostles of God as authorities, who did not themselves of their own will choose what they would believe, but faithfully transmitted to the nations the teaching received from Christ. So, even if an angel from heaven should preach otherwise, he shall be called anathema.&rdquo;&mdash;St. Isidore of Seville (c. 560&mdash;636): Etymologies, 8, 3.

## The habit of neglecting true books
Mon, 23 Oct 2017

"IT is an interesting speculation by what means the Book lost its old position in this country. This is not only an interesting speculation, but one which nearly concerns a vital matter. For if men fall into the habit of neglecting true books in an old and traditional civilization, the inaccuracy of their judgments and the illusions to which they will be subject, must increase.
"To take but one example: history. The less the true historical book is read and the more men depend upon ephemeral statement, the more will legend crystallize, the harder will it be to destroy in the general mind some comforting lie, and the great object-lesson of politics (which is an accurate knowledge of how men have acted in the past) will become at last unknown."

## But first...
Wed, 25 Oct 2017

"One of the most dreaded transitions in any essay is, "but first we have to understand ...". No. Actually, we don't. As Richard Feynman said, your theory is probably sound if you can explain it to your dear old Mom in a couple of sentences of plain words. Said differently, unless you're the Notre-Dame Cathedral, external props are not a good look. But this is just nitpicking by a guy in the cheap seats."&mdash;Ol' Remus

## Eyes Shut

"Even in the very depths of the worst possible of worst-case scenarios of crisis in the Catholic Church, denial is not helpful. The crocodile does not care how tightly we close our eyes as it eats us."&mdash;Hilary White

## Imposter Syndrome
Sun, 29 Oct 2017

"It's rampant.

"The big reason is that we're all impostors. You're not imagining that you're an impostor, it's likely that you are one.

"Everyone who is doing important work is working on something that might not work. And it's extremely likely that they're also not the very best qualified person on the planet to be doing that work.

"How could it be any other way? The odds that a pure meritocracy chose you and you alone to inhabit your spot on the ladder is worthy of Dunning-Kruger status. You've been getting lucky breaks for a long time. We all have.

"Yes, you're an imposter. So am I and so is everyone else. Superman still lives on Krypton and the rest of us are just doing our best.

"Isn't doing your best all you can do? Dropping the narrative of the impostor isn't arrogant, it's merely a useful way to get your work done without giving into Resistance.

"Time spent fretting about our status as impostors is time away from dancing with our fear, from leading and from doing work that matters."&mdash;Seth Godin

"The Saint is a medicine because he is an antidote. Indeed that is why the saint is often a martyr; he is mistaken for a poison because he is an antidote. He will generally be found restoring the world to sanity by exaggerating whatever the world neglects, which is by no means always the same element in every age. Yet each generation seeks its saint by instinct; and he is not what the people want, but rather what the people need."&mdash;G.K. Chesterton: *St. Thomas Aquinas*, Chap. I.

## Proof of its Divinity

"Buddha is only for the West to study as history, that it is a subject for understanding, and Yoga can profitably be practiced to that end. But it is not for the West an Answer, not a Solution. We must learn by acting, experiencing, and living, that is, above all by Love and Suffering,"&mdash;Jack Kerouac&mdash;letter to William Burroughs, 1954

## Chesterton&#039;s Fence
Tue, 07 Nov 2017

"In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the use of this; let us clear it away." To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: "If you don&rsquo;t see the use of it, I certainly won&rsquo;t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it."&mdash;G. K. Chesterton, *The Drift from Domesticity*

## The Task of Redemption
Thu, 09 Nov 2017

St. John Paul II describes how Christ's act of redeeming us from slavery to sin is both a free gift and a task:

"In the mystery of Redemption, Christ's victory over evil is given to us not simply for our personal advantage, but also as a task. We accept that task as we set out upon the way of the interior life, working consciously on ourselves&mdash;with Christ as our Teacher. The Gospel calls us to follow this very path. Christ's call "Follow me!" is echoed on many pages of the Gospel and is addressed to different people&mdash;not only to the Galilean fishermen whom Jesus calls to become his Apostles (cf. Mt 4:19, Jn 1:43), but also, for example, to the rich young man in the Synoptic Gospels (cf. Mt 19:16-22, Mk 10:17:22, Lk 18:18-23). Jesus's conversation with him is one of the key texts to which we must constantly return, from various points of view, as I did, for example, in the encyclical Veritatis Splendor.

"The call "Follow me!" is an invitation to set out along the path to which the inner dynamic of the mystery of Redemption leads us. This is the path indicated by the teaching, so often found in writings on the interior life and on mystical experience, about the three stages involved in "following Christ." These three stages are sometimes called "ways." We speak of the purgative way, the illuminative way, and the unitive way. In reality, these are not three distinct ways, but three aspects of the same way, along which Christ calls everyone, as he once called that young man in the Gospel.

"When the young man asks: "Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?", Christ answers him: "If you wish to enter life, keep the commandments" (Mt 19:16 et passim). And when the young man continues to ask: "Which?" Christ simply reminds him of the principal commandments of the Decalogue, and especially those from the so-called "second tablet" concerning relations with one's neighbor. In Christ's teaching, of course, all the commandments are summarized in the commandment to love God above all things and one's neighbor as oneself. He says so explicitly to a doctor of the Law in response to a question (cf. Mt 22:34-40; Mk 12:28-31). Observance of the commandments, properly understood, is synonymous with the purgative way: it means conquering sin, moral evil in its various guises. And this leads to a gradual inner purification.

"It also enables us to discover values. And hence we conclude that the purgative way leads organically into the illuminative way. Values are lights which illumine existence and, as we work on our lives, they shine ever more brightly on the horizon. So side by side with observance of the commandments&mdash;which has an essentially purgative meaning&mdash;we develop virtues. For example, in observing the commandment: "Thou shall not kill!" we discover the value of life under various aspects and we learn an ever deeper respect for it. In observing the commandment: "Thou shall not commit adultery!" we acquire the virtue of purity, and this means that we come to an ever greater awareness of the gratuitous beauty of the human body, of masculinity and femininity. This gratuitous beauty becomes a light for our actions. In observing the commandment: "Thou shall not bear false witness!" we learn the virtue of truthfulness. This not only excludes all lying and hypocrisy from our lives, but it develops within us a kind of "instinct for truth" which guides all our actions. And living thus in the truth, we acquire in our own humanity a connatural truthfulness.

"So the illuminative stage in the interior life emerges gradually from the purgative stage. With the passage of time, if we persevere in following Christ our Teacher, we feel less and less burdened by the struggle against sin, and we enjoy more and more the divine light which pervades all creation. This is most important, because it allows us to escape from a situation of constant inner exposure to the risk of sin&mdash;even though, on this earth, the risk always remains present to some degree&mdash;so as to move with ever greater freedom within the whole of the created world. The same freedom and simplicity characterizes our relations with other human beings, including those of the opposite sex. Interior light illumines our actions and shows us all the good in the created world as coming from the hand of God. Thus the purgative way and then the illuminative way form the organic introduction to what is known as the unitive way. This is the final stage of the interior journey, when the soul experiences a special union with God. This union is realized in contemplation of the divine Being and in the experience of love which flows from it with growing intensity. In this way we somehow anticipate what is destined to be ours in eternity, beyond death and the grave. Christ, supreme Teacher of the spiritual life, together with all those who have been formed in his school, teaches that even in this life we can enter onto the path of union with God."

## The Love of (a small &lsquo;g&rsquo;) god
Mon, 20 Nov 2017

"As the old saying goes, the flip side of love is hatred. You cannot care about something, and fail to hate what threatens it. This leads us to the difficult question of what to love, and the Left posits universal love, which for them means pretending to be a god and loving everything, without understanding that the love of a god is love for creation itself, not a desire to preserve each part."&mdash;<a href="http://www.amerika.org/politics/love-possesses-two-dimensions/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Brett Stevens</a>
I like to think that I love God's creation, but I love my family more particularly. Don't threaten my wife and kids or there'll be ructions!

## A Conspiracy of a very few Millionaires
Fri, 24 Nov 2017

"The point about the Press is that it is not what it is called. It is not the "popular Press." It is not the public Press. It is not an organ of public opinion. It is a conspiracy of a very few millionaires, all sufficiently similar in type to agree on the limits of what this great nation (to which we belong) may know about itself and its friends and enemies. The ring is not quite complete; there are old-fashioned and honest papers: but it is sufficiently near to completion to produce on the ordinary purchaser of news the practical effects of a corner and a monopoly. He receives all his political information and all his political marching orders from what is by this time a sort of half-conscious secret society, with very few members, but a great deal of money."&mdash;G.K. Chesterton: *Utopia of Usurers and Other Essays*

## Sauce for the Goose
Fri, 24 Nov 2017

"The fact of the matter is, one cannot be both a cultural relativist and a revolutionary. The revolutionary proposes changing the culture. A cultural relativist can never propose such a change. What standard could be used? A cultural relativist, were he honest, would hold his own culture to the same standards as a foreign culture, and say that our laws, traditions, and customs cannot be changed or criticized&mdash;for if the only yardstick of what is considered right or wrong comes from the culture, well, obviously this applies to Christendom (aka Western Culture) as well."&mdash;<a href="http://www.scifiwright.com/2017/11/fooled-by-heinlein-for-fourty-years/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">John C.

## Meditation for November 30
Thu, 30 Nov 2017

"The eternal God is thy refuge." He is a sanctuary, a refuge from the cares of life. You can get away from the misunderstanding of others by retiring into your own place of meditation. But from yourself, from your sense of failure, your weakness, your shortcomings, whether can you flee? Only to the eternal God, your refuge, until the immensity of His spirit envelopes your spirit and it loses its smallness and weakness and comes into harmony again with His.

Prayer for the Day

I pray that I may lose my limitations in the immensity of God's love. I pray that my spirit may be in harmony with His spirit.

From the original AA Meditation book, *Twenty-Four Hours a Day*, by Richmond Walker

## A Masterless House, a Pilotless Ship
Thu, 30 Nov 2017

"When a house has no master living in it, it becomes dark, vile and contemptible, choked with filth and disgusting refuse. So too is a soul which has lost its master, who once rejoiced there with his angels. This soul is darkened with sin, its desires are degraded, and it knows nothing but shame.

"Woe to the path that is not walked on, or along which the voices of men are not heard, for then it becomes the haunt of wild animals. Woe to the soul if the Lord does not walk within it to banish with his voice the spiritual beasts of sin. Woe to the house where no master dwells, to the field where no farmer works, to the pilotless ship, storm-tossed and sinking. Woe to the soul without Christ as its true pilot; drifting in the darkness, buffeted by the waves of passion, storm-tossed at the mercy of evil spirits, its end is destruction. Woe to the soul that does not have Christ to cultivate it with care to produce the good fruit of the Holy Spirit. Left to itself, it is choked with thorns and thistles; instead of fruit it produces only what is fit for burning. Woe to the soul that does not have Christ dwelling in it; deserted and foul with the filth of the passions, it becomes a haven for all the vices."&mdash;<a href="http://blog.adw.org/2017/11/a-culture-without-god-is-adrift-like-a-ship-without-a-pilot/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">St. Macarius, bishop</a>, *Hom. 28: PG 34, 710-711*

## Its Nature is to Live
Thu, 30 Nov 2017

"I think we have misunderstood the promise of Christ of the survival of the Church. You can&rsquo;t kill something whose nature it is to live. The Faith is like life itself; life is designed to live. It might not make it in this or that particular place, and it may go through periods of such reduction that we would hardly recognise it, but it can&rsquo;t be killed. Volcanoes make ash that enrich the soil; ice ages spread spores and seeds around the world. Life lives. The Faith is something even stronger."&mdash;<a href="http://whatisupwiththesynod.com/index.php/2017/11/30/you-cant-kill-something-whose-nature-it-is-to-live/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hilary White</a>

"Maybe Trump&rsquo;s voters aren&rsquo;t angry enough yet. It&rsquo;s not just a large number of women our elites have raped and victimized, it&rsquo;s our entire country. Our infrastructure is crumbling, our debt is astronomical, our universities increasingly resemble insane asylums, our largest inner cities are free-fire zones terrorized by a permanent criminal underclass. And what&rsquo;s the elite response? Oh, look, a squirrel&mdash;where the squirrel of the week is carbon emissions, or transgender rights, or railing at &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo;, or whatever other form of virtue signaling might serve to hide the fact that, oh, look, *they put remote-controlled locks on their rape dungeons*."&mdash;<a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=7767" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Eric Raymond</a>

## Lossy Press
Sat, 02 Dec 2017

"The press is a lossy and biased compression of events in the actual world, and is singularly consumed with its own rituals, status games, and incentives.

## Secular Civilization
Fri, 15 Dec 2017

&ldquo;The World is trying the experiment of attempting to form a civilized but non-Christian mentality. The experiment will fail; but we must be very patient in awaiting its collapse; meanwhile redeeming the time: so that the Faith may be preserved alive through the dark ages before us; to renew and rebuild civilization, and save the World from suicide.&rdquo;&mdash;T. S. Eliot, *Thoughts After Lambeth*, 1931.

## This House
Sun, 17 Dec 2017

"This house where such good things are done year by year has suffered all the things that every age has suffered. It has known the sudden separation of wife and husband, the sudden fall of young men under arms who will never more come home, the scattering of the living and their precarious return, the increase and the loss of fortune, all those terrors and all those lessenings and haltings and failures of hope which make up the life of man. But its Christmas binds it to its own past and promises its future; making the house an undying thing of which those subject to mortality within it are members, sharing in its continuous survival."&mdash;Hilaire Belloc: [*A Remaining Christmas*](https://oldthunderbelloc.blogspot.com/2013/12/a-remaining-christmas.html)

## The Altar of Love
Mon, 18 Dec 2017

"Where there is no giving of one self, one can only love the physical attributes of the other. Poets and philosophers have filled many volumes musing about the fleeting beauty of youth. Those who can only love that surface shine will soon grow bored. That boredom will be followed by some sort of hate or indifference. Those who love the soul are different because for them, their youth is a sacrificial present, an oblation offered in the altar of love. The men and women of God conquer each other not by possession  but by surrendering and becoming part of the beloved."&mdash;<a href="https://casorosendi.wordpress.com/2017/12/18/the-days-of-wormwood/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Carlos Caso_Rosendi</a>

## Extraordinary Decency
Mon, 18 Dec 2017

"If you can think of times in your life that you&rdquo;ve treated people with extraordinary decency and love, and pure uninterested concern, just because they were valuable as human beings. The ability to do that with ourselves.  To treat ourselves the way we would treat a really good, precious friend. Or a tiny child of ours that we absolutely loved more than life itself.  And I think it&rsquo;s probably possible to achieve that.  I think part of the job we&rsquo;re here for is to learn how to do it.  I know that sounds a little pious."&mdash;David Foster Wallace

## Clay
Sat, 23 Dec 2017

"We may consider the material world as the clay which the artist works with, to make of it something beautiful or ugly. We need not fear material things, which are neither good nor bad in the moral sense. There seems to be no active force for evil&mdash;outside of human beings themselves. Humans alone can have either evil intentions&mdash;resentments, malevolence, hate and revenge&mdash;or good intentions&mdash;love and good will, They can make something ugly or something beautiful out of the clay of their lives."&mdash;Twenty-Four Hours a Day entry for December 19

## Gender
Tue, 26 Dec 2017

"I want everyone to stop using the word &ldquo;gender&rdquo; for anything other than masculine and feminine nouns. I am male. I am of the male sex. I am not of the male gender.  You do not have choice in participating in your sexual  identity, contrary to all fashionable nonsense of the era. &ldquo;Gender&rdquo; is akin to the Marxist use of the word &ldquo;exploitation&rdquo;. It is ideologically loaded; it is nonsense on stilts. Biology is not a social construct."&mdash;Written by one of those bloggers who, for whatever reason, won't use a "real" name. Found <a href="http://www.barrelstrength.com/2017/12/20/deconstructing-jordan-peterson/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.

Oh, and by the way, I agree totally and unreservedly. I'm certainly open to the thought that we need to be willing for men and women to dress, walk and talk in ways other than how John Wayne or Rita Hayworth dressed, walked and talked, but let's be serious. Once a man, always a man. And vice versa.

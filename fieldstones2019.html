<h2 id="whats-the-matter">What's the Matter?</h2>
<p>Fri, 11 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“A naive understanding of materialism attributes to it a naive understanding of matter. Matter, common sense says, is more or less the way it appears to us in ordinary experience. It is solid, colored stuff that always tastes, smells, sounds, and feels a certain way. Materialism, on a naÃ¯ve understanding, is the view that everything that exists is like that. Even unobservable particles are assumed to be tiny solid, colored objects that have their own tastes, smells, sounds, and feels to them. Like little stones or marbles.</p>
<p>“Of course, this is all wrong.”—<a href="http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2019/01/materialism-subverts-itself.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Edward Feser</a> A pretty “Barfieldian” statement for someone who seems determined to ignore Barfield, even when his name is mentioned dozens of times by his commenters. Well, ‘philosophers’ are like that.</p>
<h2 id="that-antichrist-feeling">That Antichrist Feeling</h2>
<p>Sun, 13 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“Surface plausibility, reasonableness, persuasiveness, enjoyability… yet all the time, underneath, nagging away at me—there a revulsion, a rising tide of suspicion. The ‘balance’ of ‘evidence’ suggests that these are ‘well-meaning’ people, saying things that have ‘some value’… yet from the start, and all the time, there is this drum-beat of inner rejection. “This is what I call That Antichrist feeling—that sense that I am here dealing with an Antichrist phenomenon… “It is the knowledge of my own heart that I am dealing with some person, institution or product that has (to some degree—perhaps unconsciously to itself) a rotten, corrupt, dishonest, manipulative heart. That is pretending to be on the side of God, while actually working against God… That is pretending to be on the side of God in order to work against God.”—<a href="http://charltonteaching.blogspot.com/2019/01/that-antichrist-feeling.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bruce Charlton</a></p>
<h2 id="justice-or-love">Justice or Love</h2>
<p>Sun, 13 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“It is going-against a very mainstream—especially Protestant—view of Christianity (and the emphasis of the Apostle Paul) when I say Christianity is not—or is hardly at all—about justice. “Indeed, quite the opposite: the promise of Christ is that salvation comes to all who follow him in love—and that is a massive short-circuit of anything like justice.”—<a href="http://charltonteaching.blogspot.com/2019/01/christianity-is-not-much-about-justice.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bruce Charlton</a> Reminds me of the AA saying, “Good thing that God’s love is greater than His sense of justice—I’d hate to think where I’d be if I got what I deserve!”</p>
<h2 id="modern-lit">Modern Lit</h2>
<p>Sun, 13 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“The intelligentsia was driven to create literary modernism by a profound loathing of ordinary common readers. The intellectuals feared the masses not because they were illiterate but because, by the early twentieth century, they were becoming more literate, thanks to public education, adult education, scholarships, and cheap editions of the great books. “If more and more working people were reading the classics, if they were closing the cultural gap between themselves and the middle classes, how could intellectuals preserve their elite status as arbiters of taste and custodians of rare knowledge? They had to create a new body of modernist literature which was deliberately made so difficult and obscure that the average reader did not understand it.”—<a href="https://daily.jstor.org/was-modernism-meant-to-keep-the-working-classes-out/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jonathan Rose</a> This explains Virginia Woolf, Stein and Pound. And a lot of Joyce, Kafka, Eliot. Not to mention a lot of newer stuff. Or is it just me?</p>
<h2 id="the-state-of-current-science">The State of Current Science</h2>
<p>Tue, 15 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“Modern, Linear Faustian Science has run it’s course. The decline is obviously visible when the spokesmanship passes from Albert Einstein to Carl Sagan to Neil DeGrasse Tyson. It’s been about 40 years since we really smashed through any scientific barriers.”—<a href="http://www.amerika.org/politics/periscope-january-11-2019/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jonathan Wilkinson</a></p>
<h2 id="judging">Judging</h2>
<p>Fri, 18 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“Today’s “let’s all get along, not judge or challenge anyone” groupthink also reminds me of a major scene sequence in Milos Forman’s adaptation of Ken Kesey’s 1962 novel <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</em>.</p>
<p>“Jack Nicholson portrays R.P. McMurphy, a good time Charlie with authority figure issues. He’s playing crazy at a maximum-security insane asylum to get out of a work detail jail sentence. Years ago, they sentenced petty criminals to hard labor. I remember as a kid being in the backseat driving South and watching chain gangs cutting overgrown brush on the median of I95—Donn Pearce must have seen them too. He wrote <em>Cool Hand Luke</em>.</p>
<p>“McMurphy’s Moriarty is Nurse Ratched, the head nurse in the asylum. Louise Fletcher played this role so brilliantly—all ice and pursed lips—she had difficulty finding work after winning the Oscar for it.</p>
<p>“One afternoon, during an interminable group therapy session, McMurphy requests that the guys be allowed to watch the World Series that evening. Knowing that the last thing the other men would want to do is stand up and challenge the way she rules her kingdom, Ratched sees an opportunity to put McMurphy in his place.</p>
<p>“She”ll put the request up to a vote.</p>
<p>“McMurphy sticks his hand up to vote “yea” assuming that his fellow patients will come to the same conclusion that he has. By simply raising their arms, together the men can let this lady know that denying a simple pleasure like watching a ball game to a bunch of lunatics is absurd.</p>
<p>“Which one of you nuts has any guts?</p>
<p>“The needy fuser Cheswick is the only other one who has the courage to challenge Nurse Ratched’s command. Meeting adjourned. The men are then shuttled into the shower room for their evening cleaning. McMurphy is out of his mind with anger.</p>
<p>“If you”re a writer, this scene is a perfect example of a set-up that dramatically portrays a character’s inner change. How does Ken Kesey pay it off?</p>
<p>“From the first moment McMurphy lays eyes on Ratched, the reader/viewer knows he judges her as rotten to the core. McMurphy is not afraid to judge. His problem is that he acts on his judgments too quickly. That’s what got him in the clink in the first place.</p>
<p>“In the nuthouse, though, he is forced to keep the judgment to himself. He’s supposed to be crazy! And to McMurphy, only crazy people don’t judge, so he shouldn’t either.</p>
<p>“But when the evidence of Ratched’s evil is incontrovertible to him, he can’t help himself but act. He’s the novel’s protagonist. He’s the hero. If he doesn’t act on his judgments, there’s no story.</p>
<p>“Kesey could have made any number of choices with this scene. He could have had McMurphy act selfishly, like a child, and physically attack a guard or an inmate or himself. Something the character has a reputation for doing earlier in his life.</p>
<p>“Instead, for the first time (and the perfect time) Kesey has his character act beyond himself. He changes his behavior. McMurphy sees that these men have it within themselves to judge Ratched as a tyrant. If he can make them understand how important it is to make a judgment and to act on that judgment—even if it puts them in harm’s way—he will help them. And helping them will help him bring down tyranny. He”ll win.</p>
<p>“McMurphy, already known as a consummate hustler, challenges all of the men to take a bet. He puts all of his money on his succeeding. He will pick up a thousand pound marble bathroom vanity, throw it through the barred window, walk to a nearby bar with his buddy Cheswick, wet his whistle and watch Mickey Mantle play in the World Series”¦Who wants some of this action?</p>
<p>“He’s so convincing that only the most cynical among them take his bet.</p>
<p>“Playing McMurphy as only he could play him, Jack Nicholson grabs the edges of the vanity, squats and surges into the plumbing. He turns blue from effort. He commits to the action, gives it his best shot. When he’s drenched with sweat, spent and defeated, he walks out of the room. But not before turning to the stunned assemblage and saying:</p>
<p>““At least I tried.”</p>
<p>“As a child in the 60s and 70s, I was raised on stories like this. (I wish we had more of them today) And they”ve had a profound influence. This is why art is so important.</p>
<p>“These stories taught me that to passively disengage for fear of reprisal is cowardly. Making a judgment, taking a stand and then acting against an injustice or acting to support excellence is the stuff of the everyman hero.”—<a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2019/01/art-and-polarity/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Shawn Coyne</a></p>
<h2 id="problems-and-boundaries">Problems and Boundaries</h2>
<p>Fri, 18 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“All problems have solutions.</p>
<p>“That’s what makes them problems.</p>
<p>“The solution might involve trade-offs or expenses that you don’t want to incur. You might choose not to solve the problem. But there is a solution. Perhaps you haven’t found it yet. Perhaps you need to do more research or make some tradeoffs in what you”re hoping for.</p>
<p>“If there is no solution, then it’s not a problem.</p>
<p>“It’s a regrettable situation. It’s a boundary condition. It’s something you”ll need to live with.</p>
<p>“Which might be no fun, but there’s no sense in worrying about it or spending time or money on it, because it’s not a problem.</p>
<p>““I want to go to the wedding, but it’s a thousand miles away.” That’s a problem. You can solve it with a plane ticket and some cancelled plans.</p>
<p>““I want to go to the wedding, but I”m not willing to cancel my meeting.” That’s not a problem. That’s an unavoidable conflict. If you need to violate a law of physics to get out of a situation, it’s not a problem. But you”ve already given up turning it into a problem, so it doesn’t pay to pretend it’s solvable.</p>
<p>“Once we can walk away from unsolvable situations that pretend to be problems, we can focus our energy on the real problems in front of us.”—<a href="https://seths.blog/2019/01/problems-and-boundaries/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Seth Godin</a></p>
<h2 id="joining-forces">Joining Forces</h2>

<p>“There are plagues, and there are victims, and it’s the duty of good men not to join forces with the plagues.”—Albert Camus, <em>The Plague</em></p>
<h2 id="incredibly-stupid-smart-people">Incredibly Stupid Smart People</h2>
<p>Thu, 24 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“The great Greg Cochran will often point out that a smart person is someone who says smart things, but more important, they don’t say many dumb things. Everyone, no matter how smart, will get a dumb idea in their head or get carried away and say something stupid on occasion. It’s just not common with smart people, at least not as common as it is with dumb people. Being smart is as much the absence of stupidity as it is getting right answers or having a long list of brilliant insights.</p>
<p>“This comes up often in public discussion of the human sciences. It is remarkable how often an allegedly smart person will say things that are laughably wrong about something in biology or human evolution.” It’s worth reading the rest at: <a href="http://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=16243" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Z Man</a> blog.</p>
<h2 id="equality-outside-mathematics">Equality (outside mathematics)</h2>
<p>Thu, 24 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“Equality (outside mathematics) is a purely social conception. It applies to man as a political and economic animal. It has no place in the world of the mind. Beauty is not democratic; she reveals herself more to the few than to the many, more to the persistent and disciplined seekers than to the careless. Virtue is not democratic; she is achieved by those who pursue her more hotly than most men. Truth is not democratic; she demands special talents and special industry in those to whom she gives her favors. Political democracy is doomed if it tries to extend its demand for equality into these higher spheres. Ethical, intellectual, or aesthetic democracy is death.”—C.S. Lewis, 1944</p>
<h2 id="democratic-education">Democratic Education</h2>
<p>Thu, 24 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“Democratic education, says Aristotle, ought to mean, not the education which democrats like, but the education which will preserve democracy. Until we have realized that the two things do not necessarily go together we cannot think clearly about education.”—C.S. Lewis</p>
<h2 id="collectives">Collectives</h2>
<p>Thu, 24 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“As long as we are thinking of natural values we must say that the sun looks down on nothing half so good as a household laughing together over a meal, or two friends talking over a pint of beer, or a man alone reading a book that interests him; and that all economies, politics, laws, armies, and institutions, save insofar as they prolong and multiply such scenes, are a mere ploughing the sand and sowing the ocean, a meaningless vanity and vexation of the spirit. Collective activities are, of course, necessary, but this is the end to which they are necessary.”—C.S. Lewis, “Membership” in <em>The Weight of Glory</em></p>
<h2 id="lucifer-and-ahriman">Lucifer and Ahriman</h2>
<p>Wed, 30 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“The aim of Lucifer is to conserve the past too long; to maintain, in the present, conditions that rightly obtained in the past, but should now be superseded. He adores tradition. In particular he seeks to maintain the permeation of the mind by the ‘given’, the physical, the instinctive warmth, which men bring with them from the past and must indeed use, but which should no longer permeate, or at least not involuntarily, their mental powers. You and I, my friend, have watched him at work already, for we have seen him trying to preserve into your time the psychology and the social patterns of the Gabriel age.</p>
<p>“And what is the function, or the aim, of Ahriman?</p>
<p>“You must distinguish the function from the aim. It is the aims of both beings that we are at present concerned with. Their aim is to oppose those whom it will suffice for the present to call the true gods; but their <em>function</em> is to serve these gods against their will, and by means of that very opposition. Do not take this lightly, or repeat it glibly. The aim of Ahriman is to anticipate the future, but which can only appear in the present as a wicked caricature. In pursuit of this aim he will persuade you, if he can, to eradicate the past instead of transforming it. He abhors tradition. History is his bane. He operates, in the present age, principally in the field of mind, leaving the feelings for Lucifer to exploit. He freezes. His purpose is to destroy everything in human thinking which depends on a certain warmth, to replace wonder by sophistication, courtesy by vulgarity, understanding by calculation, imagination by statistics.”—Owen Barfield <em>Unancestral Voice</em></p>
<h2 id="politics">Politics</h2>
<p>Wed, 30 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“I am suggesting therefore that what we have to think of, and what future legislation must somehow learn to deal with, is not so much a public opinion that is sharply divided in two as it is two different publics: an A public and a B public. Or that, if this is not already the case, it is rapidly becoming so; and it seems that in the near future it will be so. Anyone who has felt the pulse, so to speak, of the intellectual climate in the English-speaking world, and of the changes that have been occurring in it over the last forty or fifty years, is likely to be impressed by the circumstance that, even at the philosophical level—even, that is, when a <em>bona fide</em> attempt is made to bridge the communication gap by recognizing the presuppositions, formulating them, debating them—it generally turns out to be impossible.”—Owen Barfield <a href="http://www.owenbarfield.org/the-politics-of-abortion/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Politics of Abortion</em></a></p>

<p>At least a few of my strong memories are strongly associated with a very particular place. The bed at nine-mile, the sofa on Stanley street, the entry hall on Dale Drive.</p>
<p>This last with just a flash, that “we” could easily take a “wrong turn” in our thoughts and carry merrily on down a “wrong” path. “Two roads diverged in a yellow wood…and that has made all the difference.”</p>

<h2 id="fathers-and-sons">Fathers and Sons</h2>
<p>Fri, 01 Mar 2019</p>
<p>“And in that moment Sherman made the terrible discovery that men make about their fathers sooner or later. For the first time he realized that the man before him was not an aging father but a boy, a boy much like himself, a boy who grew up and had a child of his own and, as best he could, out of a sense of duty and, perhaps, love, adopted a role called Being a Father so that his child would have something mythical and infinitely important: a Protector, who would keep a lid on all the chaotic and catastrophic possibilities of life. And now that boy, that good actor, had grown old and fragile and tired, wearier than ever at the thought of trying to hoist the Protector’s armor back onto his shoulders again, now, so far down the line.”—Tom Wolfe <em>Bonfire of the Vanities</em></p>
<h2 id="boring-and-dangerous">Boring and Dangerous</h2>
<p>Wed, 06 Mar 2019</p>
<p>“Life is intrinsically, well, boring and dangerous at the same time”¦ At any given moment the floor may open up. Of course, it almost never does; that’s what makes it so boring.”—Edward J. Gorey</p>
<h2 id="magic">Magic</h2>
<p>Mon, 11 Mar 2019</p>
<p>“You could say that “magic” is a recognition that you have been underestimating the world, assuming that it is boring and limited when it is your own mind that is bored and limited. And this is important, for it brings the great fundamental insight, the insight that has come to all mystics and poets : that a large part of man’s misery and pain is his own fault. For nearly three thousand years, cynical philosophers have been declaring that human life is disappointing and brief and miserable, and that the wise man has no objection to dying. But moments of “magic” bring a clear recognition that the world “out there” is infinitely interesting—so interesting that if we could “turn on” the magic at will, we would probably live for ever—or at least, want to. The magic doesn’t get in past our senses, which have thick filters on them. Blake recognised that it is as if man lived in a cold, damp cave, when outside there is warm sunlight and fresh air. “Five windows light the caverned man, through one he breathes the air . . .””—William Arkle <em>A Geography of Consciousness</em></p>
<h2 id="ressentiment">Ressentiment</h2>
<p>Sun, 17 Mar 2019</p>
<p>“Ressentiment is a self-poisoning of the mind which has quite definite causes and consequences. It is a lasting mental attitude, caused by the systematic repression of certain emotions and affects which, as such, are normal components of human nature. Their repression leads to the constant tendency to indulge in certain kinds of value delusions and corresponding value judgments. The emotions and affects primarily concerned are revenge, hatred, malice, envy, the impulse to detract, and spite.”—Max Scheler <em><a href="https://mercaba.org/SANLUIS/Filosofia/autores/Contempor%C3%A1nea/Scheller/Ressentiment.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ressentiment</a></em> H/T <a href="https://www.francisberger.com/bergers-blog/resentment-the-hate-fueling-contemporary-conceptions-of-love" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Francis Berger</a></p>

<h2 id="axiomatic">Axiomatic</h2>
<p>Sun, 24 Mar 2019</p>
<p>“There are some things that cannot be verified, or falsified. These would include all axioms of logic; even those of post-modern “paraconsistent” logics, wherein the very Law of Non-Contradiction is (implausibly) denied, but which are axiomatic on their own terms. We are out the door of “science” when we discuss logic; or the principles of mathematics for that matter. All we can say is that the world makes sense on axioms; and not otherwise.</p>
<p>“For science, or human knowledge more broadly, God is not an hypothesis, but an Axiom. Start in Aristotle, if you will, to see that the world has no purchase on sense, without the Unmoved Mover. The “Five Ways” by which the inevitability of God was demonstrated by Thomas Aquinas, and the related ways in which this was done by others before and after him, are easily misunderstood, because they are not proofs of an hypothesis but recursions. They show that, without that “God Axiom,” there can be no causation, no change, no being in itself, no gradation, no direction to an end. We need a Still Point, from which to depart. It cannot be hypothesized. It is too simple for that. You need to assume it even to contradict it.”—<a href="https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2019/03/23/the-cosmic-duh/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David Warren</a></p>
<h2 id="sloth">Sloth</h2>
<p>Mon, 08 Apr 2019</p>
<p>“One of the more misunderstood of the cardinal sins is sloth. Most see it merely as laziness, but there is more to it than that. Let’s take a moment and consider some aspects of this cardinal sin.</p>
<p>“The Greek word we translate as sloth is á¼€ÎºÎ·Î´Î¯Î± akedia (a = absence + kedos = care), meaning indifference or negligence. St. Thomas Aquinas speaks of sloth as sorrow for spiritual good. By it, we shun spiritual good as too toilsome (cf Summa Theologica II-II 35,2).</p>
<p>“Some modern commentators describe sloth as a “don’t care” feeling. Some even say it is a kind of falling out of love with God and the things of God (cf Rev 2:4). On account of sloth, the idea of right living and the gift of a transformed humanity inspires not joy, but aversion or even disgust because it is seen as too difficult or as requiring the setting aside of currently enjoyed or sinful pleasures. Through sloth, many experience sorrow rather than joy or zeal in following God and receiving a transformed human life. They are distressed at the prospect of what might have to occur should they embrace the faith more deeply.</p>
<p>“Sloth also tends to dismiss the power of grace, focusing instead on the “trouble” or effort involved in walking in the Christian way.</p>
<p>“Sloth is not merely laziness; it is more properly understood as sorrow or indifference. While sloth may sometimes look like boredom and a casual laziness toward attaining spiritual good, it can also be manifested by a frantic “busyness” with worldly things so as to avoid spiritual questions or living a reflective life.”—<a href="http://blog.adw.org/2019/04/seven-deadly-sins-sloth/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Msgr. Charles Pope</a></p>

<p>“What with history being rewritten so often, nobody knows what is true anymore. They lose track of who is an enemy and who an ally. It’s that kind of story.”</p>
<p>““They rewrite history.”</p>
<p>““Robbing people of their actual history is the same as robbing them of part of themselves. It’s a crime.”</p>
<p>“Fuka-Eri thought about that for a moment.</p>
<p>“Tengo went on, “Our memory is made up of our individual memories and our collective memories. The two are intimately linked. And history is our collective memory. If our collective memory is taken from us—is rewritten—we lose the ability to sustain our true selves.””—Haruki Murakami <em>1Q84</em></p>

<p>“Christ didn’t die to convince God to love us — He died to convince us that God loved us.”</p>
<p>I am, in general, disinclined to give too much value to detailed theological/philosophical analysis of the inner-workings of the Creator — the interaction of the Persons of the Trinity, which Person spoke to Moses, Who divided the waters, etc., so I won’t further analyze or defend that thought. John 14:15 seems an adequate entry point to a Holy life: “If ye love me, keep my commandments.”</p>
<p>We can analyze what the commandments are, and how to keep them in a particular circumstance without delving into why He considers them important, or which Person originated or communicated them. “Our Lord Jesus Christ said: Hear O Israel, The Lord our God is one Lord; and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it: Thou shalt love your neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets”</p>

<p>Sun, 21 Apr 2019</p>
<p>“MEN do not live long without gods; when the gods of the New Paganism come they will not be merely insufficient, as were the gods of Greece, nor merely false; they will be evil. One might put it in a sentence, and say that the New Paganism, foolishly expecting satisfaction, will fall, before it knows where it is, into Satanism.” — Hilaire Belloc: <em>Essays of a Catholic</em>.</p>
<h2 id="owen-barfield">Owen Barfield</h2>
<p>Sat, 27 Apr 2019</p>
<p>Owen Barfield (1898–1997) Our destiny is to become both conscious and free.</p>
<p>Barfield was writing for everybody and for all time — his core concern was nothing less than the divine destiny of each individual person and of all people collectively.</p>
<p>Barfield’s immediate relevance is profound; it is to solve the core problem of modern times - which is ‘alienation’: i.e. the deep sense of meaninglessness, purposelessness, and isolation from people and things.</p>
<p>The understanding which makes this possible is that history, the present and the future can be understood as aiming at both consciousness and freedom (where consciousness means awareness of our thinking and ourselves, and freedom refers to free will, or human agency).</p>
<p>Barfield’s scheme is that humans began as conscious-but-not-free; and we evolved — evolved in the sense of changing by unfolding according to a (divine) developmental plan — to become free but not conscious (which is where we are now, in modern times — unaware of meaning, purpose, relation) — and we ought to be aiming at the condition where we are both self-aware and fully-conscious. Engaged with (and participating in) reality as free agents.</p>
<p>Even more briefly, humanity began as conscious, became free; and is destined to become both — simultaneously.</p>
<p>Barfield proposes real, coherent, and clear answers to the most fundamental problems.</p>

<h2 id="no-big-thing">No Big Thing</h2>
<p>Wed, 1 May, 2019</p>
<p>“I have found that one of my favorite quotes from St. Augustine is not all that well known. Here it is in Latin, followed by my own translation:</p>
<p>Quod minimum, minimum est, Sed in minimo fidelem esse, magnum est.</p>
<p>What is a little thing, is (just) a little thing. But to be faithful in a little thing is a great thing.”—<a href="http://blog.adw.org/2019/05/greatness-little-things-reflection-quote-st-augustine/">Msgr. Charles Pope</a> (from St. Augustine’s De Doctrina Christiana, IV, 35)</p>

<h2 id="change">Change</h2>
<p>Sun, 5 May, 2019</p>
<p>“A changeless society would be as intolerable for people as the present society of constant change. Convivial reconstruction requires limits on the rate of compulsory change. An unlimited rate of change makes lawful community meaningless. Law is based on the retrospective judgment of peers about circumstances that occur ordinarily and are likely to occur again. If the rate of change which affects all circumstances accelerates beyond some point, such judgments cease to be valid. Lawful society breaks down. Social control does not accommodate community participation and becomes the function of experts. Educators define how people are to be trained and retrained throughout their lives—shaped and reshaped until they fit the demands of industry and are attracted by its profits. Ideologues define what is right or wrong. The tooling of man for the milieu becomes the major industry when this milieu changes beyond a certain rate; then man’s need for language and law, for memories and myths, imposes limits to the change of tools.”—Ivan Illich, <em>Tools for Conviviality</em></p>
<h2 id="knavish-imbecility">Knavish Imbecility</h2>
<p>Sun, 5 May, 2019</p>
<p>“The Catholic Church is an institution I am bound to hold divine — but for unbelievers a proof of its divinity might be found in the fact that no merely human institution conducted with such knavish imbecility would have lasted a fortnight.”—Hilaire Belloc (A comment made to William Temple, quoted in The Life of Hilaire Belloc by Robert Speaight)</p>

<h2 id="serenity-vs-apathy">Serenity vs Apathy</h2>
<p>Sun, 5 May, 2019</p>
<p>“Serenity is not the same as apathy, although both words denote a state that is beyond caring. One difference is that serenity is cheerful and apathy is gloomy. The serene man has overcome the world, whereas the apathetic man has been overcome by it. Both men have lost their ambitions, but the serene man left them behind, like a newspaper on a park bench, whereas the apathetic man had them torn from his fingers in a desperate but losing fight with a band of wild banditti.”—<a href="https://orthosphere.wordpress.com/2019/05/05/divest-yourself-or-be-divested/">J. M. Smith</a></p>
<h2 id="regardless-power">Regardless Power</h2>
<p>Sun, 5 May, 2019</p>
<p>“I am, however, equally troubled by another specter, another threat. I’m not sure what to call it, perhaps the threat of emancipatory technics, the emancipation here being something like the total emancipation from our embodied-in-the-world human condition. Together they constitute what I think of as the Charybdis and Scylla of the modern techo-social order. What I have in mind here is the development and deployment of technology without any regard for the givenness of our condition (any, I should note, does a lot of work in this sentence). We might also refer to the temptation of what Albert Borgmann has termed”regardless power" or, as Katherine Hayles once put it, to view our bodies as “fashion accessories rather than the ground of being.” It seems to me that such power is, yes, problematic whether it is authoritarian or democratic. I am, in other words, indiscriminately suspicious of post-humanist fantasies whatever their ideological sources.</p>
<p>“I suppose one way of thinking about all of this is to ask whether it might not be best to respect the integrity of each component in the circuit I described above: mind, body, technology, world. That presupposes, of course, that we might be able to arrive at some meaningful understanding of what such integrity might entail. (Needless to say, I think we are just beginning a hard lesson in what happens when we do not respect the integrity of the world, a lesson which will not be halted by our inability to get a theoretical handle on nature’s integrity.) Or, to put it another way, should we yield to the temptation of allowing our minds and our technology to act in tandem without any regard to the limits implicit in our being bodies in the world?”—<a href="https://tinyletter.com/lmsacasas/letters/the-convivial-society-no-14">L.

<h2 id="creeds-must-disagree">Creeds Must Disagree</h2>
<p>Sun, 5 May 2019</p>
<p>“CREEDS must disagree: it is the whole fun of the thing. If I think the universe is triangular, and you think it is square, there cannot be room for two universes. We may argue politely, we may argue humanely, we may argue with great mutual benefit; but, obviously, we must argue. Modern toleration is really a tyranny. It is a tyranny because it is a silence. To say that I must not deny my opponent’s faith is to say I must not discuss it . . . It is absurd to have a discussion on Comparative Religions if you don’t compare them.”—G.K. Chesterton: <em>Illustrated London News, Oct. 10, 1908.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-myth-as-enemy">The Myth as Enemy</h2>
<p>Mon, 6 May 2019</p>
<p>“The great enemy of truth is very often not the lie – deliberate, contrived and dishonest – but the myth – persistent, persuasive and unrealistic. Too often we hold fast to the clichés of our forebears. We subject all facts to a prefabricated set of interpretations. We enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought.”—John F. Kennedy <em>Commencement Address at Yale University, 11 June, 1962</em></p>
<h2 id="the-human-mind-needs">The Human Mind Needs</h2>
<p>Mon, 6 May 2019</p>
<p>“NOW the human mind needs—─if it would be united to God—the guidance of the things of sense; for as the apostle says to the Romans (1:20): ‘The invisible things of him are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made.’ Hence in divine worship it is necessary to make use of certain corporal acts, so that by their means, as by certain signs, man’s mind may be stirred up to those spiritual acts whereby it is knit to God. Consequently religion has certain interior acts which are its chief ones and which essentially belong to it; but it has also external which are secondary and which are subordinated to the interior acts.”—St. Thomas Aquinas: <em>Summa Theologica, II-II, 81, 7.</em></p>
<h2 id="romanticizing-the-past">Romanticizing the Past</h2>
<p>Mon, 6 May 2019</p>
<p>“I understand the impulse, I really do. I think it was from Alan Jacobs that I first learned about the poet W. H. Auden’s distinction between those whose tendency is to look longingly back at some better age in the past and those who look hopefully toward some ideal future: Arcadians and Utopians respectively, he called them. Auden took these to be matters of temperament. If so, then I would readily admit to being temperamentally Arcadian. For that reason, I think I well understand the temptation and try to be on guard against it.”—<a href="https://thefrailestthing.com/2019/02/06/dont-romanticize-the-present/">L. M. Sacasas</a></p>
<h2 id="more-huxley-than-orwell">More Huxley than Orwell</h2>
<p>Mon, 6 May 2019</p>
<p>“<em>Fahrenheit 451</em> isn’t really about censorship, after all, and it’s unfortunate that the novel has been reduced to that theme in the popular imagination.</p>
<p>“Bradbury makes clear that the firemen who famously start fires to burn books are doing so only long after people stopped reading books of their own accord as other forms of media came to dominate their experience. Actually, to be more precise, they did not stop reading altogether. They stopped reading certain kinds of books: the ones that made demands of the reader, intellectual, emotional, moral demands that might upset their fragile sense of well-being.</p>
<p>“<em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, in other words, is more Huxley than Orwell.”—<a href="https://thefrailestthing.com/2018/06/15/were-reading-fahrenheit-451-wrong/">L. M. Sacasas</a></p>
<h2 id="gell-mann-amnesia">Gell-Mann Amnesia</h2>
<p>Mon, 6 May 2019</p>
<p>“Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray’s case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward—reversing cause and effect. I call these the”wet streets cause rain" stories. Paper’s full of them.</p>
<p>“In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.”—Michael Crichton</p>
<h2 id="every-schoolboy-knows">Every Schoolboy Knows</h2>
<p>Mon, 6 May 2019</p>
<p>From Gregory Bateson’s <em>Mind and Nature</em></p>
<p>“Official education was telling people almost nothing of the nature of all those things on the seashores and in the redwood forests, in the deserts and the plains. Even grown-up persons with children of their own cannot give a reasonable account fo concepts such as entropy, sacrament, syntax, number, quantity, pattern, linear relation, name, class, relevance, energy, redundancy, force, probability, parts, whole, information, tautology, homology, mass (either Newtonian or Christian), explanation, description, rule of dimensions, logical type, metaphor, topology, and so on. What are butterflies? What are starfish? What are beauty and ugliness?” p. 3</p>
<p>Chapter II, “Every Schoolboy Knows”</p>
<p>Quoting Macauley: &amp;ldquo:Every schoolboy knows who imprisoned Montezuma and who strangled Atahualpa.”</p>
<p>&amp;ldquo:Those who lack all idea that it is possible to be wrong can learn nothing but know-how.” p.28</p>
<p>&amp;ldquo:It is worthwhile to attempt a tentative recognition of certain basic presuppositons which all minds must share or, conversely, to define mind by listing a number of such basic communicational characteristics:&amp;rdquo: p.29</p>

<p>Bateson is another connection that I owe to The Whole Earth Catalog. I believe that I purchased and first read Steps in about 1984, then reread and made these notes in early October of 2008. Reading them now, I’m struck by how closely they seem to relate to Owen Barfield’s writing.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-matter">What's the Matter?</h2>
<p>Fri, 11 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“A naive understanding of materialism attributes to it a naive understanding of matter. Matter, common sense says, is more or less the way it appears to us in ordinary experience. It is solid, colored stuff that always tastes, smells, sounds, and feels a certain way. Materialism, on a naÃ¯ve understanding, is the view that everything that exists is like that. Even unobservable particles are assumed to be tiny solid, colored objects that have their own tastes, smells, sounds, and feels to them. Like little stones or marbles.</p>
<p>“Of course, this is all wrong.”—<a href="http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2019/01/materialism-subverts-itself.html">Edward Feser</a></p>
<p>A pretty “Barfieldian” statement for someone who seems determined to ignore Barfield, even when his name is mentioned dozens of times by his commenters. Well, ‘philosophers’ are like that.</p>
<h2 id="that-antichrist-feeling">That Antichrist Feeling</h2>
<p>Sun, 13 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“Surface plausibility, reasonableness, persuasiveness, enjoyability… yet all the time, underneath, nagging away at me—there a revulsion, a rising tide of suspicion. The ‘balance’ of ‘evidence’ suggests that these are ‘well-meaning’ people, saying things that have ‘some value’… yet from the start, and all the time, there is this drum-beat of inner rejection. “This is what I call That Antichrist feeling—that sense that I am here dealing with an Antichrist phenomenon… “It is the knowledge of my own heart that I am dealing with some person, institution or product that has (to some degree—perhaps unconsciously to itself) a rotten, corrupt, dishonest, manipulative heart. That is pretending to be on the side of God, while actually working against God… That is pretending to be on the side of God in order to work against God.”—<a href="http://charltonteaching.blogspot.com/2019/01/that-antichrist-feeling.html">Bruce Charlton</a></p>
<h2 id="justice-or-love">Justice or Love</h2>
<p>Sun, 13 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“It is going-against a very mainstream—especially Protestant—view of Christianity (and the emphasis of the Apostle Paul) when I say Christianity is not—or is hardly at all—about justice. “Indeed, quite the opposite: the promise of Christ is that salvation comes to all who follow him in love—and that is a massive short-circuit of anything like justice.”—<a href="http://charltonteaching.blogspot.com/2019/01/christianity-is-not-much-about-justice.html">Bruce Charlton</a></p>
<p>Reminds me of the AA saying, “Good thing that God’s love is greater than His sense of justice—I’d hate to think where I’d be if I got what I deserve!”</p>
<h2 id="modern-lit">Modern Lit</h2>
<p>Sun, 13 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“The intelligentsia was driven to create literary modernism by a profound loathing of ordinary common readers. The intellectuals feared the masses not because they were illiterate but because, by the early twentieth century, they were becoming more literate, thanks to public education, adult education, scholarships, and cheap editions of the great books.</p>
<p>“If more and more working people were reading the classics, if they were closing the cultural gap between themselves and the middle classes, how could intellectuals preserve their elite status as arbiters of taste and custodians of rare knowledge? They had to create a new body of modernist literature which was deliberately made so difficult and obscure that the average reader did not understand it.”—<a href="https://daily.jstor.org/was-modernism-meant-to-keep-the-working-classes-out/">Jonathan Rose</a></p>
<p>This explains Virginia Woolf, Stein and Pound. And a lot of Joyce, Kafka, Eliot. Not to mention a lot of newer stuff. Or is it just me?</p>
<h2 id="the-state-of-current-science">The State of Current Science</h2>
<p>Tue, 15 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“Modern, Linear Faustian Science has run it’s course. The decline is obviously visible when the spokesmanship passes from Albert Einstein to Carl Sagan to Neil DeGrasse Tyson. It’s been about 40 years since we really smashed through any scientific barriers.”—<a href="http://www.amerika.org/politics/periscope-january-11-2019/">Jonathan Wilkinson</a></p>
<h2 id="judging">Judging</h2>
<p>Fri, 18 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“Today’s “let’s all get along, not judge or challenge anyone” groupthink also reminds me of a major scene sequence in Milos Forman’s adaptation of Ken Kesey’s 1962 novel <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</em>.</p>
<p>“Jack Nicholson portrays R.P. McMurphy, a good time Charlie with authority figure issues. He’s playing crazy at a maximum-security insane asylum to get out of a work detail jail sentence. Years ago, they sentenced petty criminals to hard labor. I remember as a kid being in the backseat driving South and watching chain gangs cutting overgrown brush on the median of I95—Donn Pearce must have seen them too. He wrote <em>Cool Hand Luke</em>.</p>
<p>“McMurphy’s Moriarty is Nurse Ratched, the head nurse in the asylum. Louise Fletcher played this role so brilliantly—all ice and pursed lips—she had difficulty finding work after winning the Oscar for it.</p>
<p>“One afternoon, during an interminable group therapy session, McMurphy requests that the guys be allowed to watch the World Series that evening. Knowing that the last thing the other men would want to do is stand up and challenge the way she rules her kingdom, Ratched sees an opportunity to put McMurphy in his place.</p>
<p>“She”ll put the request up to a vote.</p>
<p>“McMurphy sticks his hand up to vote “yea” assuming that his fellow patients will come to the same conclusion that he has. By simply raising their arms, together the men can let this lady know that denying a simple pleasure like watching a ball game to a bunch of lunatics is absurd.</p>
<p>“Which one of you nuts has any guts?</p>
<p>“The needy fuser Cheswick is the only other one who has the courage to challenge Nurse Ratched’s command. Meeting adjourned. The men are then shuttled into the shower room for their evening cleaning. McMurphy is out of his mind with anger.</p>
<p>“If you”re a writer, this scene is a perfect example of a set-up that dramatically portrays a character’s inner change. How does Ken Kesey pay it off?</p>
<p>“From the first moment McMurphy lays eyes on Ratched, the reader/viewer knows he judges her as rotten to the core. McMurphy is not afraid to judge. His problem is that he acts on his judgments too quickly. That’s what got him in the clink in the first place.</p>
<p>“In the nuthouse, though, he is forced to keep the judgment to himself. He’s supposed to be crazy! And to McMurphy, only crazy people don’t judge, so he shouldn’t either.</p>
<p>“But when the evidence of Ratched’s evil is incontrovertible to him, he can’t help himself but act. He’s the novel’s protagonist. He’s the hero. If he doesn’t act on his judgments, there’s no story.</p>
<p>“Kesey could have made any number of choices with this scene. He could have had McMurphy act selfishly, like a child, and physically attack a guard or an inmate or himself. Something the character has a reputation for doing earlier in his life.</p>
<p>“Instead, for the first time (and the perfect time) Kesey has his character act beyond himself. He changes his behavior. McMurphy sees that these men have it within themselves to judge Ratched as a tyrant. If he can make them understand how important it is to make a judgment and to act on that judgment—even if it puts them in harm’s way—he will help them. And helping them will help him bring down tyranny. He”ll win.</p>
<p>“McMurphy, already known as a consummate hustler, challenges all of the men to take a bet. He puts all of his money on his succeeding. He will pick up a thousand pound marble bathroom vanity, throw it through the barred window, walk to a nearby bar with his buddy Cheswick, wet his whistle and watch Mickey Mantle play in the World Series”¦Who wants some of this action?</p>
<p>“He’s so convincing that only the most cynical among them take his bet.</p>
<p>“Playing McMurphy as only he could play him, Jack Nicholson grabs the edges of the vanity, squats and surges into the plumbing. He turns blue from effort. He commits to the action, gives it his best shot. When he’s drenched with sweat, spent and defeated, he walks out of the room. But not before turning to the stunned assemblage and saying:</p>
<p>““At least I tried.”</p>
<p>“As a child in the 60s and 70s, I was raised on stories like this. (I wish we had more of them today) And they”ve had a profound influence. This is why art is so important.</p>
<p>“These stories taught me that to passively disengage for fear of reprisal is cowardly. Making a judgment, taking a stand and then acting against an injustice or acting to support excellence is the stuff of the everyman hero.”—<a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2019/01/art-and-polarity/">Shawn Coyne</a></p>
<h2 id="problems-and-boundaries">Problems and Boundaries</h2>
<p>Fri, 18 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“All problems have solutions.</p>
<p>“That’s what makes them problems.</p>
<p>“The solution might involve trade-offs or expenses that you don’t want to incur. You might choose not to solve the problem. But there is a solution. Perhaps you haven’t found it yet. Perhaps you need to do more research or make some tradeoffs in what you”re hoping for.</p>
<p>“If there is no solution, then it’s not a problem.</p>
<p>“It’s a regrettable situation. It’s a boundary condition. It’s something you”ll need to live with.</p>
<p>“Which might be no fun, but there’s no sense in worrying about it or spending time or money on it, because it’s not a problem.</p>
<p>““I want to go to the wedding, but it’s a thousand miles away.” That’s a problem. You can solve it with a plane ticket and some cancelled plans.</p>
<p>““I want to go to the wedding, but I”m not willing to cancel my meeting.” That’s not a problem. That’s an unavoidable conflict. If you need to violate a law of physics to get out of a situation, it’s not a problem. But you”ve already given up turning it into a problem, so it doesn’t pay to pretend it’s solvable.</p>
<p>“Once we can walk away from unsolvable situations that pretend to be problems, we can focus our energy on the real problems in front of us.”—<a href="https://seths.blog/2019/01/problems-and-boundaries/">Seth Godin</a></p>
<h2 id="joining-forces">Joining Forces</h2>

<p>“There are plagues, and there are victims, and it’s the duty of good men not to join forces with the plagues.”—Albert Camus, <em>The Plague</em></p>
<h2 id="incredibly-stupid-smart-people">Incredibly Stupid Smart People</h2>
<p>Thu, 24 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“The great Greg Cochran will often point out that a smart person is someone who says smart things, but more important, they don’t say many dumb things. Everyone, no matter how smart, will get a dumb idea in their head or get carried away and say something stupid on occasion. It’s just not common with smart people, at least not as common as it is with dumb people. Being smart is as much the absence of stupidity as it is getting right answers or having a long list of brilliant insights.</p>
<p>“This comes up often in public discussion of the human sciences. It is remarkable how often an allegedly smart person will say things that are laughably wrong about something in biology or human evolution.” It’s worth reading the rest at: <a href="http://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=16243">The Z Man</a> blog.</p>
<h2 id="equality-outside-mathematics">Equality (outside mathematics)</h2>
<p>Thu, 24 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“Equality (outside mathematics) is a purely social conception. It applies to man as a political and economic animal. It has no place in the world of the mind. Beauty is not democratic; she reveals herself more to the few than to the many, more to the persistent and disciplined seekers than to the careless. Virtue is not democratic; she is achieved by those who pursue her more hotly than most men. Truth is not democratic; she demands special talents and special industry in those to whom she gives her favors. Political democracy is doomed if it tries to extend its demand for equality into these higher spheres. Ethical, intellectual, or aesthetic democracy is death.”—C.S. Lewis, 1944</p>
<h2 id="democratic-education">Democratic Education</h2>
<p>Thu, 24 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“Democratic education, says Aristotle, ought to mean, not the education which democrats like, but the education which will preserve democracy. Until we have realized that the two things do not necessarily go together we cannot think clearly about education.”—C.S. Lewis</p>
<h2 id="collectives">Collectives</h2>
<p>Thu, 24 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“As long as we are thinking of natural values we must say that the sun looks down on nothing half so good as a household laughing together over a meal, or two friends talking over a pint of beer, or a man alone reading a book that interests him; and that all economies, politics, laws, armies, and institutions, save insofar as they prolong and multiply such scenes, are a mere ploughing the sand and sowing the ocean, a meaningless vanity and vexation of the spirit. Collective activities are, of course, necessary, but this is the end to which they are necessary.”—C.S. Lewis, “Membership” in <em>The Weight of Glory</em></p>
<h2 id="lucifer-and-ahriman">Lucifer and Ahriman</h2>
<p>Wed, 30 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“The aim of Lucifer is to conserve the past too long; to maintain, in the present, conditions that rightly obtained in the past, but should now be superseded. He adores tradition. In particular he seeks to maintain the permeation of the mind by the ‘given’, the physical, the instinctive warmth, which men bring with them from the past and must indeed use, but which should no longer permeate, or at least not involuntarily, their mental powers. You and I, my friend, have watched him at work already, for we have seen him trying to preserve into your time the psychology and the social patterns of the Gabriel age.</p>
<p>“And what is the function, or the aim, of Ahriman?</p>
<p>“You must distinguish the function from the aim. It is the aims of both beings that we are at present concerned with. Their aim is to oppose those whom it will suffice for the present to call the true gods; but their <em>function</em> is to serve these gods against their will, and by means of that very opposition. Do not take this lightly, or repeat it glibly. The aim of Ahriman is to anticipate the future, but which can only appear in the present as a wicked caricature. In pursuit of this aim he will persuade you, if he can, to eradicate the past instead of transforming it. He abhors tradition. History is his bane. He operates, in the present age, principally in the field of mind, leaving the feelings for Lucifer to exploit. He freezes. His purpose is to destroy everything in human thinking which depends on a certain warmth, to replace wonder by sophistication, courtesy by vulgarity, understanding by calculation, imagination by statistics.”—Owen Barfield <em>Unancestral Voice</em></p>
<h2 id="politics">Politics</h2>
<p>Wed, 30 Jan 2019</p>
<p>“I am suggesting therefore that what we have to think of, and what future legislation must somehow learn to deal with, is not so much a public opinion that is sharply divided in two as it is two different publics: an A public and a B public. Or that, if this is not already the case, it is rapidly becoming so; and it seems that in the near future it will be so. Anyone who has felt the pulse, so to speak, of the intellectual climate in the English-speaking world, and of the changes that have been occurring in it over the last forty or fifty years, is likely to be impressed by the circumstance that, even at the philosophical level—even, that is, when a <em>bona fide</em> attempt is made to bridge the communication gap by recognizing the presuppositions, formulating them, debating them—it generally turns out to be impossible.”—Owen Barfield <a href="http://www.owenbarfield.org/the-politics-of-abortion/"><em>The Politics of Abortion</em></a></p>

<p>At least a few of my strong memories are strongly associated with a very particular place. The bed at nine-mile, the sofa on Stanley street, the entry hall on Dale Drive.</p>
<p>This last with just a flash, that “we” could easily take a “wrong turn” in our thoughts and carry merrily on down a “wrong” path. “Two roads diverged in a yellow wood…and that has made all the difference.”</p>

<h2 id="miracles">Miracles</h2>
<p>Sat, 09 Feb 2019</p>
<p>“They say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical persons, to make modern and familiar, things supernatural and causeless.

<p>Fri, 01 Mar 2019</p>
<p>“And in that moment Sherman made the terrible discovery that men make about their fathers sooner or later. For the first time he realized that the man before him was not an aging father but a boy, a boy much like himself, a boy who grew up and had a child of his own and, as best he could, out of a sense of duty and, perhaps, love, adopted a role called Being a Father so that his child would have something mythical and infinitely important: a Protector, who would keep a lid on all the chaotic and catastrophic possibilities of life. And now that boy, that good actor, had grown old and fragile and tired, wearier than ever at the thought of trying to hoist the Protector’s armor back onto his shoulders again, now, so far down the line.”—Tom Wolfe <em>Bonfire of the Vanities</em></p>
<h2 id="boring-and-dangerous">Boring and Dangerous</h2>
<p>Wed, 06 Mar 2019</p>
<p>“Life is intrinsically, well, boring and dangerous at the same time. At any given moment the floor may open up. Of course, it almost never does; that’s what makes it so boring.”—Edward J. Gorey</p>
<h2 id="magic">Magic</h2>
<p>Mon, 11 Mar 2019</p>
<p>“You could say that ‘magic’ is a recognition that you have been underestimating the world, assuming that it is boring and limited when it is your own mind that is bored and limited. And this is important, for it brings the great fundamental insight, the insight that has come to all mystics and poets : that a large part of man’s misery and pain is his own fault. For nearly three thousand years, cynical philosophers have been declaring that human life is disappointing and brief and miserable, and that the wise man has no objection to dying. But moments of “magic” bring a clear recognition that the world ‘out there’ is infinitely interesting—so interesting that if we could ‘turn on’ the magic at will, we would probably live for ever—or at least, want to. The magic doesn’t get in past our senses, which have thick filters on them. Blake recognised that it is as if man lived in a cold, damp cave, when outside there is warm sunlight and fresh air. ‘Five windows light the caverned man, through one he breathes the air . . .’”—William Arkle <em>A Geography of Consciousness</em></p>
<h2 id="ressentiment">Ressentiment</h2>
<p>Sun, 17 Mar 2019</p>
<p>“Ressentiment is a self-poisoning of the mind which has quite definite causes and consequences. It is a lasting mental attitude, caused by the systematic repression of certain emotions and affects which, as such, are normal components of human nature. Their repression leads to the constant tendency to indulge in certain kinds of value delusions and corresponding value judgments. The emotions and affects primarily concerned are revenge, hatred, malice, envy, the impulse to detract, and spite.”—Max Scheler <a href="https://mercaba.org/SANLUIS/Filosofia/autores/Contempor%C3%A1nea/Scheller/Ressentiment.pdf"><em>Ressentiment</em></a></p>

<h2 id="axiomatic">Axiomatic</h2>
<p>Sun, 24 Mar 2019</p>
<p>“There are some things that cannot be verified, or falsified. These would include all axioms of logic; even those of post-modern “paraconsistent” logics, wherein the very Law of Non-Contradiction is (implausibly) denied, but which are axiomatic on their own terms. We are out the door of “science” when we discuss logic; or the principles of mathematics for that matter. All we can say is that the world makes sense on axioms; and not otherwise.</p>
<p>“For science, or human knowledge more broadly, God is not an hypothesis, but an Axiom. Start in Aristotle, if you will, to see that the world has no purchase on sense, without the Unmoved Mover. The “Five Ways” by which the inevitability of God was demonstrated by Thomas Aquinas, and the related ways in which this was done by others before and after him, are easily misunderstood, because they are not proofs of an hypothesis but recursions. They show that, without that “God Axiom,” there can be no causation, no change, no being in itself, no gradation, no direction to an end. We need a Still Point, from which to depart. It cannot be hypothesized. It is too simple for that. You need to assume it even to contradict it.”—<a href="https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2019/03/23/the-cosmic-duh/">David Warren</a></p>
<h2 id="sloth">Sloth</h2>
<p>Mon, 08 Apr 2019</p>
<p>“One of the more misunderstood of the cardinal sins is sloth. Most see it merely as laziness, but there is more to it than that. Let’s take a moment and consider some aspects of this cardinal sin.</p>
<p>“The Greek word we translate as sloth is á¼€ÎºÎ·Î´Î¯Î± akedia (a = absence + kedos = care), meaning indifference or negligence. St. Thomas Aquinas speaks of sloth as sorrow for spiritual good. By it, we shun spiritual good as too toilsome (cf Summa Theologica II-II 35,2).</p>
<p>“Some modern commentators describe sloth as a “don’t care” feeling. Some even say it is a kind of falling out of love with God and the things of God (cf Rev 2:4). On account of sloth, the idea of right living and the gift of a transformed humanity inspires not joy, but aversion or even disgust because it is seen as too difficult or as requiring the setting aside of currently enjoyed or sinful pleasures. Through sloth, many experience sorrow rather than joy or zeal in following God and receiving a transformed human life. They are distressed at the prospect of what might have to occur should they embrace the faith more deeply.</p>
<p>“Sloth also tends to dismiss the power of grace, focusing instead on the “trouble” or effort involved in walking in the Christian way.</p>
<p>“Sloth is not merely laziness; it is more properly understood as sorrow or indifference. While sloth may sometimes look like boredom and a casual laziness toward attaining spiritual good, it can also be manifested by a frantic “busyness” with worldly things so as to avoid spiritual questions or living a reflective life.”—<a href="http://blog.adw.org/2019/04/seven-deadly-sins-sloth/">Msgr. Charles Pope</a></p>

<p>““They rewrite history.”</p>
<p>““Robbing people of their actual history is the same as robbing them of part of themselves. It’s a crime.”</p>
<p>“Fuka-Eri thought about that for a moment.</p>
<p>“Tengo went on, “Our memory is made up of our individual memories and our collective memories. The two are intimately linked. And history is our collective memory. If our collective memory is taken from us—is rewritten—we lose the ability to sustain our true selves.””—Haruki Murakami <em>1Q84</em></p>

<p>Sun, Apr 21, 2019</p>
<p>One of those “blasts from the past” that seem like original-to-me thoughts (as in I don’t remember reading them first) which I recall with complete visual memory of where I was when they first came to me. Location is the office at Saint Saviour’s Pro-Cathedral in Nelson, BC. Late winter or very early spring (slushy snow in the street), early 1980s.</p>
<p>“Christ didn’t die to convince God to love us — He died to convince us that God loved us.”</p>
<p>I am, in general, disinclined to give too much value to detailed theological/philosophical analysis of the inner-workings of the Creator — the interaction of the Persons of the Trinity, which Person spoke to Moses, Who divided the waters, etc., so I won’t further analyze or defend that thought. John 14:15 seems an adequate entry point to a Holy life: “If ye love me, keep my commandments.”</p>
<p>We can analyze what the commandments are, and how to keep them in a particular circumstance without delving into why He considers them important, or which Person originated or communicated them. “Our Lord Jesus Christ said: Hear O Israel, The Lord our God is one Lord; and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it: Thou shalt love your neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets”</p>

<p>“MEN do not live long without gods; when the gods of the New Paganism come they will not be merely insufficient, as were the gods of Greece, nor merely false; they will be evil. One might put it in a sentence, and say that the New Paganism, foolishly expecting satisfaction, will fall, before it knows where it is, into Satanism.” — Hilaire Belloc: <em>Essays of a Catholic</em>.</p>
<h2 id="owen-barfield">Owen Barfield</h2>
<p>Sat, 27 Apr 2019</p>
<p>Owen Barfield (1898–1997) Our destiny is to become both conscious and free.</p>
<p>Barfield was writing for everybody and for all time — his core concern was nothing less than the divine destiny of each individual person and of all people collectively.</p>
<p>Barfield’s immediate relevance is profound; it is to solve the core problem of modern times - which is ‘alienation’: i.e. the deep sense of meaninglessness, purposelessness, and isolation from people and things.</p>
<p>The understanding which makes this possible is that history, the present and the future can be understood as aiming at both consciousness and freedom (where consciousness means awareness of our thinking and ourselves, and freedom refers to free will, or human agency).</p>
<p>Barfield’s scheme is that humans began as conscious-but-not-free; and we evolved — evolved in the sense of changing by unfolding according to a (divine) developmental plan — to become free but not conscious (which is where we are now, in modern times — unaware of meaning, purpose, relation) — and we ought to be aiming at the condition where we are both self-aware and fully-conscious. Engaged with (and participating in) reality as free agents.</p>
<p>Even more briefly, humanity began as conscious, became free; and is destined to become both — simultaneously.</p>
<p>Barfield proposes real, coherent, and clear answers to the most fundamental problems.</p>

<h2 id="change">Change</h2>
<p>Sun, 5 May, 2019</p>
<p>“A changeless society would be as intolerable for people as the present society of constant change. Convivial reconstruction requires limits on the rate of compulsory change. An unlimited rate of change makes lawful community meaningless. Law is based on the retrospective judgment of peers about circumstances that occur ordinarily and are likely to occur again. If the rate of change which affects all circumstances accelerates beyond some point, such judgments cease to be valid. Lawful society breaks down. Social control does not accommodate community participation and becomes the function of experts. Educators define how people are to be trained and retrained throughout their lives—shaped and reshaped until they fit the demands of industry and are attracted by its profits. Ideologues define what is right or wrong. The tooling of man for the milieu becomes the major industry when this milieu changes beyond a certain rate; then man’s need for language and law, for memories and myths, imposes limits to the change of tools.”—Ivan Illich, <em>Tools for Conviviality</em></p>

<p>“Serenity is not the same as apathy, although both words denote a state that is beyond caring. One difference is that serenity is cheerful and apathy is gloomy. The serene man has overcome the world, whereas the apathetic man has been overcome by it. Both men have lost their ambitions, but the serene man left them behind, like a newspaper on a park bench, whereas the apathetic man had them torn from his fingers in a desperate but losing fight with a band of wild banditti.”—<a href="https://orthosphere.wordpress.com/2019/05/05/divest-yourself-or-be-divested/">J.

<h2 id="regardless-power">Regardless Power</h2>
<p>Sun, 5 May, 2019</p>
<p>“I am, however, equally troubled by another specter, another threat. I’m not sure what to call it, perhaps the threat of emancipatory technics, the emancipation here being something like the total emancipation from our embodied-in-the-world human condition. Together they constitute what I think of as the Charybdis and Scylla of the modern techo-social order. What I have in mind here is the development and deployment of technology without any regard for the givenness of our condition (any, I should note, does a lot of work in this sentence). We might also refer to the temptation of what Albert Borgmann has termed”regardless power" or, as Katherine Hayles once put it, to view our bodies as “fashion accessories rather than the ground of being.” It seems to me that such power is, yes, problematic whether it is authoritarian or democratic. I am, in other words, indiscriminately suspicious of post-humanist fantasies whatever their ideological sources.</p>
<p>“I suppose one way of thinking about all of this is to ask whether it might not be best to respect the integrity of each component in the circuit I described above: mind, body, technology, world. That presupposes, of course, that we might be able to arrive at some meaningful understanding of what such integrity might entail. (Needless to say, I think we are just beginning a hard lesson in what happens when we do not respect the integrity of the world, a lesson which will not be halted by our inability to get a theoretical handle on nature’s integrity.) Or, to put it another way, should we yield to the temptation of allowing our minds and our technology to act in tandem without any regard to the limits implicit in our being bodies in the world?”—<a href="https://tinyletter.com/lmsacasas/letters/the-convivial-society-no-14">L.

<p>“CREEDS must disagree: it is the whole fun of the thing. If I think the universe is triangular, and you think it is square, there cannot be room for two universes. We may argue politely, we may argue humanely, we may argue with great mutual benefit; but, obviously, we must argue. Modern toleration is really a tyranny. It is a tyranny because it is a silence. To say that I must not deny my opponent’s faith is to say I must not discuss it . . . It is absurd to have a discussion on Comparative Religions if you don’t compare them.”—G.K.

<p>“NOW the human mind needs—─if it would be united to God—the guidance of the things of sense; for as the apostle says to the Romans (1:20): ‘The invisible things of him are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made.’ Hence in divine worship it is necessary to make use of certain corporal acts, so that by their means, as by certain signs, man’s mind may be stirred up to those spiritual acts whereby it is knit to God. Consequently religion has certain interior acts which are its chief ones and which essentially belong to it; but it has also external which are secondary and which are subordinated to the interior acts.”—St. Thomas Aquinas: <em>Summa Theologica, II-II, 81, 7.</em></p>

Auden’s distinction between those whose tendency is to look longingly back at some better age in the past and those who look hopefully toward some ideal future: Arcadians and Utopians respectively, he called them. Auden took these to be matters of temperament. If so, then I would readily admit to being temperamentally Arcadian. For that reason, I think I well understand the temptation and try to be on guard against it.”—<a href="https://thefrailestthing.com/2019/02/06/dont-romanticize-the-present/">L. M. Sacasas</a></p>

<p>“<em>Fahrenheit 451</em> isn’t really about censorship, after all, and it’s unfortunate that the novel has been reduced to that theme in the popular imagination.</p>
<p>“Bradbury makes clear that the firemen who famously start fires to burn books are doing so only long after people stopped reading books of their own accord as other forms of media came to dominate their experience. Actually, to be more precise, they did not stop reading altogether. They stopped reading certain kinds of books: the ones that made demands of the reader, intellectual, emotional, moral demands that might upset their fragile sense of well-being.</p>

<p>Mon, 6 May 2019</p>
<p>“Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray’s case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward—reversing cause and effect. I call these the”wet streets cause rain" stories. Paper’s full of them.</p>
<p>“In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.”—Michael Crichton</p>

<p>“Official education was telling people almost nothing of the nature of all those things on the seashores and in the redwood forests, in the deserts and the plains. Even grown-up persons with children of their own cannot give a reasonable account fo concepts such as entropy, sacrament, syntax, number, quantity, pattern, linear relation, name, class, relevance, energy, redundancy, force, probability, parts, whole, information, tautology, homology, mass (either Newtonian or Christian), explanation, description, rule of dimensions, logical type, metaphor, topology, and so on. What are butterflies? What are starfish? What are beauty and ugliness?” p. 3</p>

<p>“Those who lack all idea that it is possible to be wrong can learn nothing but know-how.” p.28</p>
<p>“It is worthwhile to attempt a tentative recognition of certain basic presuppositons which all minds must share or, conversely, to define mind by listing a number of such basic communicational characteristics:” p.29</p>

<p>Bateson is another connection that I owe to The Whole Earth Catalog. I believe that I purchased and first read Steps in about 1984, then reread and made these notes in early October of 2008. Reading them now, I’m struck by how closely they seem to relate to Owen Barfield’s writing.</p>

<p>“The message of the Book of Revelation is a strong antidote to times like these, now, in the past, and in the future: be strong, be prepared, and be willing to suffer, realizing that no matter how powerful and glamorous evil may seem, Jesus is the victor. We must persevere and realize that we are swept up into a cosmic battle that is much larger than our current situation but that reaches us nonetheless. We must choose sides.

<p>“Ronald Knox said, of <em>The Imitation of Christ</em>, that anyone who claims to be “fond” of it is either a saint, or he is lying. This most formidable of late mediaeval spiritual guides — to call it a “devotional book” is to set out in the wrong direction — was meant as an acid bath. It strips off the skin of one’s vanity, then claws at what lies underneath. The charm in the writing lands like salt. There are no “happyface” moments, unless one counts a surprising chapter, whose number I won’t give lest some innocent try to start there. That chapter can be read as a transcription of mystical experience, along the unitive way. But I take it not as “encouragement” but as grounding and orientation, for the book is deadly serious beginning to end, and the point of it is to point the reader where the Christian must go: on a path that unavoidably includes “the dark night of the soul.””—<a href="https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2019/05/08/tough-loves/">David Warren</a></p>

<p>Mon, 13 May 2019</p>
<p>“But in God there is a passionate and anguished longing for man. In God there is a tragic deficiency which is satisfied by the great gain of man’s birth in Him. The mystics taught the mystery of God’s birth in man. But there is another mystery; that of man’s birth in God. There is a summons, a call in man, for God to be born in him. This is the mystery of Christianity, the mystery of Christ, which is unknown to the Hindu mystics, to Plotinus, or to any of the abstract monistic mystics. God and man are greater than God alone. The substantial multinomial being revealed in One is greater than a One undifferentiated. Only the myth of God’s longing for man and for man’s love can bring us near to the final mystery.”—Nikolai Berdyaev <em>The Meaning of the Creative Act</em></p>

<h2 id="hospitality">Hospitality</h2>
<p>Sat, 18 May 2019</p>
<p><strong>Illich</strong>: Hospitality was a condition consequent on a good society in politics, <em>politaea</em>, and by now might be the starting point of <em>politaea</em>, of politics. But this is difficult because hospitality requires a threshold over which I can lead you — and TV, internet, newspaper, the idea of communication, abolished the walls and therefore also the friendship, the possibility of leading somebody over the door. Hospitality requires a table around which you can sit and if people get tired they can sleep. You have to belong to a subculture to say, we have a few mattresses here. It’s still considered highly improper to conceive of this as the ideal moments in a day or a year. Hospitality is deeply threatened by the idea of personality, of scholastic status. I do think that if I had to choose one word to which hope can be tied it is hospitality. A practice of hospitality— recovering threshold, table, patience, listening, and from there generating seedbeds for virtue and friendship on the one hand — on the other hand radiating out for possible community, for rebirth of community.</p>

<h2 id="creating-need">Creating Need</h2>
<p>Sat, 18 May 2019</p>
<p><strong>Brown</strong>: So Deschooling was based on the insight that the school industry teaches people, not teaches them but manipulates them, into thinking that they have certain needs that the school itself alone can satisfy?</p>
<p><strong>Illich</strong>: That they have needs. Not all people whom I knew as a young man had needs. We were hungry but we couldn’t translate the hunger into a need for food stuff. They were hungry for a tortilla, for comida, not calories. The idea that people are born with needs, that needs can be translated into rights, that these rights can be translated into entitlements, is a development of the modern world and it’s reasonable, it’s acceptable, it’s obvious only for people who have had some of their educational needs awakened or created, then satisfied and then learned that we have less than others. Schooling, which we engage in and supposedly creates equal opportunities, has become the unique, never before attempted way of dividing the whole society into classes. Everybody knows in which level of his twelve or sixteen years of schooling he has dropped out, and in addition knows what price tag is attached to the higher schooling he has gotten.</p>
<p><strong>Brown</strong>: So you get a precise definition of where you are in the social hierarchy by how much schooling your had or how much schooling you don’t have, so you didn’t know you needed fourteen years and a postgraduate degree or to get out of high school depending upon where you lived.</p>
<p><strong>Illich</strong>: It’s a history of degrading the majority of people.</p>
<p><strong>Brown</strong>: So you take somebody who’s poor and you modernize the poverty by not only having a person that doesn’t have a lot of material goods but now lacks the mental self-confidence that his father or grandfather had before that.</p>
<p><strong>Illich</strong>: And I can create a world for him in which he needs constantly something which–at that time I searched for a word I didn’t findd, context sensitive help. You know, when you are in front of a computer and when you are in that program and put in Word Perfect it tells you what help you need at that point at which you are. This is instructions for use. This is incorporation of teaching into the object with which you encounter at its high point. We have created a world in which people constantly are grateful if they are taken by the hand to know how to use a knife or to use the coffee maker or how to go on from here in text composing.</p>

<h2 id="objectify">Objectify</h2>
<p>Sat, 18 May 2019</p>
<p><strong>Illich</strong>: …Inevitably modern technology has polarized society. It has polluted the environment. It has disabled very simple native abilities and made them dependent on objects.</p>
<p><strong>Brown</strong>: Like an automobile.</p>
<p><strong>Illich</strong>: An automobile which cuts out the use value from your feet. Like an automobile which makes the world inaccessible when actually that means in Latin using your feet to get somewhere. The automobile makes it unthinkable. I recently had the question, “You’re a liar!” when I said to somebody I walked down the spine of the Andes. Every Spaniard in the 16th, 17th century did that. The idea that somebody could just walk! He can jog perhaps in the morning but he can’t walk anywhere! The world has become inaccessible because we drive there.</p>
<p><strong>Brown</strong>: So the objects, like a car or even like a school, change who we are.</p>
<p><strong>Illich</strong>: Who you are and even more deeply they change the way your senses work. Traditionally the gaze was conceived as a way of fingering, of touching. The old Greeks spoke about looking as a way of sending out my <em>psychopodia</em> [?], my soul’s limbs, to touch your face and establish a relationship between the two of us which is this relationship, and this relationship was called vision. Then, after Galileo at the time of Kepler, the idea developed that the eyes are receptors into which light brings something from the outside, keeping you separate from me even when I look at you. Even if I gaze at you. Even if I enjoy your face. People began to conceive of their eyes as some kind of camera obscura. In our age people conceive of their eyes and actually use them as if they were part of a machinery. They speak about interface. Anybody who says to me, I want to have an interface with you, I say please go somewhere else, to a toilet or wherever you want, to a mirror. Anybody who says, I want to communicate with you, I say can’t you talk? Can’t you speak? Can’t you recognize that there’s a deep otherness between me and you, so deep that it would be offensive for me to be programmed in the same way you are.</p>

<p>“I have an idea that some men are born out of their due place. Accident has cast them amid strangers in their birthplace, and the leafy lanes they have known from childhood or the populous streets in which they have played, remain but a place of passage. they may spend their whole lives aliens among their kindred and remain aloof among the only scenes they have ever known. Perhaps it is this sense of strangeness that sends men far and wide in the search for something permanent, to which they may attach themselves. Perhaps some deep-rooted atavism urges the wanderer back to lands which his ancestors left in the dim beginnings of history. Sometimes a man hits upon a place to which he mysteriously feels that he belongs. Here is the home he sought, and he will settle amid scenes that he has never seen before, among men he has never known, as though they were familiar to him from his birth. Here at last he finds rest.”— W. Somerset Maugham, <em>The Moon and Sixpence</em> 1919</p>

<h2 id="rebirth">Rebirth</h2>
<p>Thu, 23 May 2019</p>
<p>“In his book The Everlasting Man, G. K. Chesterton describes the power of orthodoxy to renew itself, in a chapter titled “Five Deaths of the Faith.” Christianity, he tells us, was never really reborn, because it never really died. The cultures it lived in died, so Christianity was rediscovered five times in the history of the West, as one cultural epoch was superseded by another. This happened after the fall of Rome, then in the twelfth century at the end of the feudal era, again when the medieval synthesis gave way to the secular energies of the Renaissance, again when the Renaissance fell to the new rationalism of the Enlightenment, and yet again as Enlightenment values have begun to dissolve with the arrival of our postindustrial age.”—G. K. Chesterton, <em>The Everlasting Man</em>, 250 quoted in Robert Inchausti, <em>Subversive Orthodoxy</em>, 16</p>

<p>Thu, 23 May 2019</p>
<p>“Eckhart had neither the desire to take aught away from the content of Christianity, nor the wish to add anything to it; but he desired to bring forward this content anew in his own way. It forms no part of the spiritual needs of a personality such as he was to set up new truths of this or the other kind in the place of old ones. Such a personality has grown completely intertwined with the content which it has received from tradition; but it craves to give to this content a new form, a new life.”—Rudolf Steiner, <em>Mystics of the Renaissance</em></p>

<p>Sat, 25 May 2019</p>
<p>“There are but two ways of forming an opinion in science. One is the scientific method; the other, the scholastic. One can judge from experiement, or one can blindly accept authority. To the scientific mind, experimental proof is all-important, and theory is merely a convenience in description, to be junked when it no lo0nger fits. To the academic mind, authority is everything, and facts are junked when they do not fit theory laid down by authority.”—Robert A. Heinlein, <em>Life-Line</em></p>

<p>“At the same time that we were studying the Greek Tragic Poets, he (Bowyer, Head Master of the Grammar School, Christ’s Hospital) made us read Shakespeare and Milton as lessons: and they were the lessons, too, which required most time and trouble to bring up so as to escape his censure. I learnt from him, that Poetry, even that of the loftiest and, seemingly, that of the wildest odes, had a logic of its own, as severe as that of science; and more difficult, because more subtle, more complex, and dependent upon more, and more fugitive, causes.”—S. T. Coleridge, <em>Biographia Literaria</em></p>
<h2 id="spritual-not-religious">Spritual, Not Religious</h2>
<p>Tue, 11 Jun 2019</p>
<p>“A familiar A.A. cliché describes the fellowship’s program as “spiritual rather than religious,” and members of Alcoholics Anonymous tend to enforce this distinction vigorously upon both those who comment on their program and themselves at A.A. meetings. This deep and real concern over its image as “spiritual” bears vivid witness to A.A.’s authentic modernity, especially as a religious phenomenon. The mistrust of religious claims that matured in the Enlightenment has so deepened and spread that, in the twentieth centure, secularization has become the hallmark of modernity. Over those same two centuries between the Enlightenment and the present, however, the reaction of Romanticism against Enlightenment rationalism has also become culturally internalized and effectively stylized. Thus, in yet another paradox, moderns readily accept “feeling” even as they resolutely reject “belief” as a wellspring of personal action, at least so long as it does not intrude upon the autonomy of others.”—Ernie Kurtz, <em>Not God</em></p>

Or rather, a mysterious Spirit can put us in touch with it, if it wishes us to see this permanent other landscape. Time passes, thousands of years pass, but at the same instant that we see this contemporary world, the ancient world, the world of the Bible, is concealed beneath it, still there and still real.

<p>Sat, 6 Jul 2019</p>
<p>“To sum up all in one word–what the soul is in the body, that are Christians in the world. The soul is dispersed through all the members of the body, and Christians are scattered through all the cities of the world. The soul dwells in the body, yet is not of the body; and Christians dwell in the world, yet are not of the world. The invisible soul is guarded by the visible body, and Christians are known indeed to be in the world, but their godliness remains invisible. The flesh hates the soul, and wars against it, though itself suffering no injury, because it is prevented from enjoying pleasures; the world also hates the Christians, though in nowise injured, because they abjure pleasures. The soul loves the flesh that hates it, and [loves also] the members; Christians likewise love those that hate them. The soul is imprisoned in the body, yet preserves that very body; and Christians are confined in the world as in a prison, and yet they are the preservers of the world. The immortal soul dwells in a mortal tabernacle; and Christians dwell as sojourners in corruptible [bodies], looking for an incorruptible dwelling in the heavens. The soul, when but ill-provided with food and drink, becomes better; in like manner, the Christians, though subjected day by day to punishment, increase the more in number. God has assigned them this illustrious position, which it were unlawful for them to forsake.”—Diagnetus, <em><a href="http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/diognetus-roberts.html">The Epistle of Mathetes to Diognetus</a></em></p>
<h2 id="cognitive-liberty">Cognitive Liberty</h2>
<p>Mon, 8 Jul 2019</p>
<p>The aim of the chapter is to draw attention to a fundamental right that is neglected in the law but that is highly relevant for neuroethics: cognitive liberty or freedom of thought. Although an internationally accepted human right, it has not gained practical legal importance. However, any regulation of neurotechnologies has to be evaluated in its light. As the right is unfamiliar to policy makers and even to many lawyers and legal scholars, its historical development and the main arguments for its recognition are sketched. Furthermore, some suggestions for its interpretation, scope, and contours are forwarded and remaining open questions identified. According to international human rights law, the right is of absolute nature so that interferences cannot be justified for interests of the common good or paternalistic reasons. Whether this strict prohibition of intervening into other persons’ minds can and should be sustained even in light of putative pressing public interests and various neuroethical considerations is one of the novel questions neuroscience poses for the law.—Christoph Bublitz, Faculty of Law, University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany <em><a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-007-4707-4_166">Cognitive Liberty or the International Human Right to Freedom of Thought</a></em></p>

<p>“The intellectual is, quite simply, a human being who has a pencil in his or her hand when reading a book.”—George Steiner</p>
<p>“There’s a way of reading that is like writing. You feel in collaboration… You have a pen in your hand, you’re going along in a way that’s, like, half creating it as you go. And you’re also strip-mining it for anything you can use… you’re sifting for what could be gold.”—Patricia Lockwood</p>
<p>“Every piece of art I’ve ever made was because I saw bad and could do better, or saw great and needed to catch up.”—John T. Unger</p>
<p>“Full ownership of a book only comes when you have made it a part of yourself, and the best way to make yourself a part of it — which comes to the same thing — is by writing in it. Why is marking a book indispensable to reading it? First, it keeps you awake — not merely conscious, but wide awake. Second, reading, if it is active, is thinking, and thinking tends to express itself in words, spoken or written. The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks. Third, writing your reactions down helps you to remember the thoughts of the author. Reading a book should be a conversation between you and the author….Marking a book is literally an expression of your differences or your agreements…It is the highest respect you can pay him..”—Mortimer J.

Hence the more fault you find, the deeper you are. It comes from being grounded in nothing but the shallow soil of the present, with no sense of history except for a series of pre-approved narratives intended to culminate in an argument against the recent past, which was bad because it prevented the wonderful possible Tomorrow from happening Today.

<p>“Big money isn’t hard to come by. All it costs is a lifetime of devotion. But no ballerina ever works harder. Captain, that’s not your style; you don’t want to make money, you simply want to spend money.”</p>
<p>“Correct, sir! So I can’t see why you would want to take Mike’s wealth away from him.” “Because great wealth is a curse—unless you enjoy money-making for its own sake. Even then it has serious drawbacks.”</p>
<p>“Oh, piffle! Jubal, you talk like a harem guard trying to sell a whole man on the advantages of being a eunuch.”</p>
<p>“Possibly,” agreed Jubal. “The mind’s ability to rationalize its own shortcomings is unlimited; I am no exception. Since I, like yourself, sir, have no interest in money other than to spend it, it is impossible for me to get rich. Conversely, there has never been any danger that I would fail to scrounge the modest amount needed to feed my vices, since anyone with the savvy not to draw to a small pair can do that. But great wealth?….Captain, you don’t know what an Old Man of the Sea great wealth is. Its owner is beset on every side, like beggars in Bombay, each demanding that he invest or give away part of his wealth. He becomes suspicious—honest friendship is rarely offered him; those who could have been friends are too fastidious to be jostled by beggars, too proud to risk being mistaken for one.</p>
<p>“Worse yet, his family is always in danger. Captain, have your daughters ever been threatened with kidnapping?”</p>
<p>“What? Good Lord, no!”</p>
<p>“If you possessed the wealth Mike had thrust on him, you would have those girls guarded night and day—still you would not rest, because you would never be sure of the guards. Look at the last hundred or so kidnappings and note how many involved a trusted employee . . . and how few victims escaped alive. Is there anything money can buy which is worth having your daughters’ necks in a noose?”</p>
<p>Van Tromp looked thoughtful. “I’ll keep my mortgaged house, Jubal.”</p>

<p>esr goes on to make interesting and important comments about the currently hot Richard Epstein scandal and its larger context, seriously worth reading and thinking about.</p>
<p>I’m posting it here, however, to note the map/territory statement, which Gregory Bateson speaks about at length in <em>Steps to an Ecology of Mind</em> (1972) and/or <em>Mind and Nature</em> (1979), Bateson being an “English anthropologist, social scientist, linguist, visual anthropologist, semiotician, and cyberneticist” per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Bateson">Wikipedia</a> and a founding participant, with his wife Margaret Mead, in the Macy Conferences. Stewart Brand introduced me to his work via the WEC, and it’s been at least somewhat influential in my muddled thinking.</p>

<p>Principles that we suspend during difficult times aren’t really principles. Principles really count when they’re difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>That’s not the same thing, though, as refusing to consider the edge cases.</p>
<p>“Free speech,” is a fine principle, one to live by. But shouting “fire” in a crowded movie theater isn’t allowed, for good reason.</p>
<p>The edge cases are always subject to endless debate. There are no easy bright lines. It’s tempting, then, to never consider the edge cases. A rule’s a rule.</p>
<p>But principles without judgment aren’t the easy path they seem to be. Because without our judgment on the edge cases, we’ve given up responsibility. It’s no longer our decision if we’re not making a decision.</p>

<p>“Three rules [Lou Reed] and I came up with – rules to live by. The first one is don’t be afraid of anyone. Imagine living your life so that you are afraid of no one. Second is get a really good bullshit detector and learn how to use it. And third is be really, really tender.”—Laurie Anderson</p>

<p>W -I went outside and it was worse.</p>
<p>Dr - How was it worse.</p>
<p>W - There was this storm.</p>
<p>Dr - so, how did you feel when you saw the storm?</p>
<p>W - I felt frozen.</p>
<p>Dr - Heartbreaking?</p>
<p>W - Frozen.</p>
<p>Dr - Frozen, cold frozen? Frozen to the touch?</p>
<p>W - No, like how you feel when you are scared and can’t breath or talk or do anything. I felt like this evil, like it was looking at me.</p>
<p>Dr - This evil. Well, what do you think this evil wanted?</p>
<p>W - You.</p>
<p>Dr - You?</p>
<p>W - Not me, everyone.</p>
<h2 id="the-race">The Race</h2>
<p>Sat, 27 Jul 2019</p>
<p>“In a society caught up in the race for the better, limits on change are experienced as a threat. The commitments to the better at any cost makes the good impossible at all costs. Failure to renew the bill of goods frustrates the expectation of what is possible, while renewal of the bill of goods intensifies the expectations of unattainable progress. What people have and what they are about to get are equally exasperating to them. Accelerating change has become both addictive and intolerable. At this point the balance among stability, change and tradition has been upset; society has lost both its roots in shared memories and its bearings for innovation. Judgement on precedents has lost its value.”— Ivan Illich, <em>Tools for Conviviality</em></p>
<h2 id="compassion">Compassion</h2>
<p>Sun, 04 Aug 2019</p>
<p>“‘Need’ now means wanting someone else’s money. ‘Greed’ means wanting to keep your own. ‘Compassion’ is when a politician arranges the transfer.”—Joseph Sobran</p>
<h2 id="science">Science</h2>
<p>Mon, 05 Aug 2019</p>
<p>“Our modern conception of science is a bureaucratic mechanism called ‘scientific method’ which denies the existence of human intuition, and thus our humanity. It is never actually followed—no scientist ever discovered anything in a time-serving, methodical way; especially not on billion-dollar machines. But still we praise and believe in this method, or such derivatives as Popper’s ‘falsifiability,’ because we are easily pleased, profligate, and hopelessly glib.”—<a href="https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2019/08/05/a-call-to-revolt/">David Warren</a></p>

<p>“A scientific discovery is very convincing, but at the same time scientific knowledge is never definitive and is always open to revision. This is a central point. Science establishes its credibility and its reliability through its refusal to be definitive and certain.”—Carlo Rovelli</p>
<h2 id="silence">Silence</h2>
<p>Tue, 06 Aug 2019</p>
<p>“Silence must be excluded at all cost, since it awakens you to the emptiness that looms on the edge of modern life, threatening to confront you with the dreadful truth, that you have nothing whatever to say.”—Roger Scruton</p>

<h2 id="maturin-on-democracy">Maturin on Democracy</h2>
<p>Wed, 07 Aug 2019</p>
<p>‘Jack,’ said Stephen, ‘I have been contemplating on your words about the nature of the majority, your strangely violent, radical, and even — forgive me — democratic words, which, with their treasonable implication of ‘one man, one vote’, might be interpreted as an attack on the sacred rights of property; and I should like to know how you reconcile them with your support of a Tory ministry in the House.’</p>
<p>‘Oh, as for that,’ said Jack, ‘I have no difficulty at all. It is entirely a matter of scale and circumstance. Everyone knows that on a large scale democracy is pernicious nonsense — a country or even a county cannot be run by a self-seeking parcel of tub-thumping politicians working on popular emotion, rousing the mob. Even at Brooks’s, which is a hotbed of democracy, the place is in fact run by the managers and those that don’t like it may either do the other thing or join Boodle’s; while as for a man-of-war, it is either an autocracy or it is nothing, nothing at all — mere nonsense. You saw what happened to the poor French navy at the beginning of the Revolutionary War…’</p>
<p>‘Dear Jack, I do not suppose literal democracy in a ship of the line nor even in a little small row-boat. I know too much of the sea,’ added Stephen, not without complacency.</p>
<p>‘…while at the other end of the scale, although ‘one man, one vote’ certainly smells of brimstone and the gallows, everyone has always accepted it in a jury trying a man for his life. An inclosure belongs to this scale: it too decides men’s lives. I had not realized how thoroughly it does so until I came back from sea and found that Griffiths and some of his friends had persuaded my father to join with them in inclosing Woolcombe Common…</p>
<p>‘Stephen, I do assure you. I was brought up rough when I was a little chap, after my mother’s death, sometimes at the village school, sometimes running wild; and I knew these men intimately as boys, and now to see them at the mercy of landlords, farmers, and God help us parish officers for poor relief, hurts me so that I can scarcely bring myself to go there again. And I am determined the same thing shall not happen to Simmon’s Lea, if ever I can prevent it. The old ways had disadvantages, of course, but here — and I speak only of what I know — it was a human life, and the people knew its ways and customs through and through.</p>

<p>Fri, 16 Aug 2019</p>
<p>“We don’t live our lives by choice, but by default. We play the roles we are born to. We don’t live our lives, we dispose of them. We throw them away because we don’t know any better. And the reason we don’t know any better is because we never asked. We never questioned or doubted. Never stood up. Never drew a line. We never walked up to our parents or our spiritual advisers or our teachers or any of the other formative presences in our early lives and asked one simple. honest, straightforward question. The one question that must be answered before any other question can be asked: “What the hell is going on here?”—Jed McKenna, <em>Spiritual Warfare</em></p>
<h2 id="cogito">Cogito</h2>
<p>Fri, 16 Aug 2019</p>
<p>“What do we know for sure? That’s the real question. That’s what the cogito is. That’s what solipsism is. This isn’t theory. This isn’t belief or faith. This is the basic fact of existence. It’s all about figuring out exactly what we know for certain as opposed to everything else. It’s truly amazing that something so glaringly obvious and irrefutable is so universally ignored by science and philosophy and religion.”—Jed McKenna</p>

<h2 id="writing-it-down">Writing it Down</h2>
<p>Fri, 16 Aug 2019</p>
<p>“The reason for writing it down on paper or on a computer where you can see it is because the brain, unlikely as it may sound, is no place for serious thinking. Any time you have serious thinking to do, the first step is to get the whole shootin’ match out of your head and set it up someplace where you can walk around it and see it from all sides. Attack, switch sides and counter-attack. You can’t do that while it’s still in your head. Writing it out allows you to act as your own teacher, your own critic, your own opponent. By externalizing your thoughts, you can become your own guru; judging yourself, giving feedback, providing a more objective and elevated perspective.”—Jed McKenna, <em>Spiritual Enlightenment: The Damnedest Thing</em></p>
<h2 id="mice">Mice</h2>
<p>Fri, 16 Aug 2019</p>
<p>“Close your eyes and get quiet for a minute, until the chatter starts up. Then isolate one of the voices and imagine the person speaking as a mouse. Pick it up by the tail and drop it into a mason jar. Then isolate another voice, pick it up by the tail, drop it in the jar. And so on. Drop in any high-maintenance parental units, drop in any contractors, lawyers, colleagues, children, anyone who is whining in your head. Then put the lid on, and watch all these mouse people clawing at the glass, jabbering away, trying to make you feel like shit because you won’t do what they want - won’t give them more money, won’t be more successful, won’t see them more often. Then imagine that there is a volume-control button on the bottle. Turn it all the way up for a minute, and listen to the stream of angry, neglected, guilt-mongering voices. Then turn it all the way down and watch the frantic mice lunge at the glass, trying to get to you. Leave it down, and get back to your shitty first draft. A writer friend of mine suggests opening the jar and shooting them all in the head. But I think he’s a little angry, and I’m sure nothing like this would ever occur to you.”—Anne Lamott, <em>Bird by Bird</em>, p. 27</p>
<h2 id="dealing-words">Dealing Words</h2>
<p>Sun, 18 Aug 2019</p>
<p>“I am, by calling, a dealer in words; and words are, of course, the most powerful drug used by mankind. Not only do words infect, ergotise, narcotise, and paralyse, but they enter into and colour the minutest cells of the brain, very much as madder mixed with a stag’s food at the Zoo colours the growth of the animal’s antlers. Moreover, in the case of the human animal, that acquired tint, or taint, is transmissible. May I give you an instance? There is a legend which has been transmitted to us from the remotest ages. It has entered into many brains and coloured not a few creeds. It is this: Once upon a time, or rather, at the very birth of Time, when the Gods were so new that they had no names, and Man was still damp from the clay of the pit whence he had been digged, Man claimed that he, too, was in some sort a deity. The Gods were as just in those days as they are now. They weighed his evidence and decided that Man’s claim was good - that he was, in effect, a divinity, and, as such, entitled to be freed from the trammels of mere brute instinct, and to enjoy the consequence of his own acts. But the Gods sell everything at a price. Having conceded Man’s claim, the legend goes that they came by stealth and stole away this godhead, with intent to hide it where Man should never find it again. But that was none so easy. If they hid it anywhere on Earth, the Gods foresaw that Man, the inveterate hunter - the father, you might say, of all hunters - would leave no stone unturned nor wave unplumbed till he had recovered it. If they concealed it among themselves, they feared that Man might in the end batter his way up even to the skies. And, while they were all thus at a stand, the wisest of the Gods, who afterwards became the God Brahm, said,”I know. Give it to me!" And he closed his hand upon the tiny unstable light of Man’s stolen godhead, and when that great Hand opened again, the light was gone. “All is well,” said Brahm. “I have hidden it where Man will never dream of looking for it. I have hidden it inside Man himself.” “Yes, but whereabouts inside Man have you hidden it?” all the other Gods asked. “Ah,” said Brahm, that is my secret, and always will be; unless and until Man discovers it for himself.”—Rudyard Kipling, <em>Surgeons and the Soul, A Book of Words</em></p>
<h2 id="science-explains">Science Explains</h2>
<p>Sun, 18 Aug 2019</p>
<p>“The widespread cultural notion that science has explained most of the world is scandalously unjustified. For all we know, we’ve explained only very, very little; practically nothing. We just don’t know what kinds of fundamental causal forces and organizing principles may kick in when systems become complex enough to be seen with the naked eye outside a laboratory. Inability to acknowledge this represents a catastrophic failure of skepticism.”—Bernardo Kastrup, <em>Brief Peeks Beyond</em></p>
<h2 id="tolerance">Tolerance</h2>
<p>Sun, 25 Aug 2019</p>
<p>“Tolerance is creditable in our liberal ethos, and liberal sentimentality therefore guarantees a surfeit of false, affected and exaggerated tolerance. You can, in fact, be tolerant only under two very rigid conditions. You must disapprove of the behavior you tolerate, and you must have the power to stop it. If you do not disapprove of the behavior, you are indifferent, not tolerant. If you cannot stop it, you are merely resigned. Most of what passes for tolerance is actually indifference or resignation.”—<a href="https://orthosphere.wordpress.com/2019/08/25/bloody-thoughts/">J. M. Smith</a></p>
<h2 id="indoctrinated">Indoctrinated</h2>
<p>Tue, 27 Aug 2019</p>
<p>“Ideally, what should be said to every child, repeatedly, throughout his or her school life is something like this: ‘You are in the process of being indoctrinated. We have not yet evolved a system of education that is not a system of indoctrination. We are sorry, but it is the best we can do. What you are being taught here is an amalgam of current prejudice and the choices of this particular culture. The slightest look at history will show how impermanent these must be. You are being taught by people who have been able to accommodate themselves to a regime of thought laid down by their predecessors. It is a self-perpetuating system. Those of you who are more robust and individual than others, will be encouraged to leave and find ways of educating yourself—educating your own judgement. Those that stay must remember, always and all the time, that they are being moulded and patterned to fit into the narrow and particular needs of this particular society.’”—Doris Lessing, <em>The Golden Notebook</em>, p. 16</p>

<p>“’It’s just politics.’</p>
<p>“No one ever says, ‘it’s just governance.’</p>
<p>“Politics is organized sparring about power, without much regard for efficacy or right or wrong.</p>
<p>“Governance is the serious business of taking responsibility for leadership.</p>
<p>“Over the last twenty years, the mass media has shifted, from “here’s the news,” to, “hey, it’s just media.” As a result, a system has been built in which situations, emergencies and bad news have been packaged and promoted twenty-four hours a day.</p>
<p>“In the face of that maelstrom of noise, it’s easy to come to the conclusion that the world is more dangerous and unstable than it has ever been.</p>
<p>“When we have a chance to speak up for governance, we can strike a blow against politics.</p>
<p>“Because even though it doesn’t make compelling TV, the long-term challenges ahead of us aren’t going to respond to politics.</p>

When a religious scheme is shattered…it is not merely the vices that are let loose. The vices are, indeed, let loose, and they wander and do damage. But the virtues are let loose also; and the virtues wander more wildly, and the virtues do more terrible damage. The modern world is full of the old Christian virtues gone mad. The virtues have gone mad because they have been isolated from each other and are wandering alone. Thus some scientists care for truth; and their truth is pitiless. Thus some humanitarians only care for pity; and their pity (I am sorry to say) is often untruthful.”—G. K. Chesterton, <em>Orthodoxy</em></p>

But then, little by little, the words become only sounds, a random collection of glottals and fricatives, a storm of whirling phonemes, and finally the whole thing just collapses into gibberish.”—Paul Auster, <em>Country of Last Things</em></p>
<h2 id="the-myth-of-modernity">The Myth of Modernity</h2>
<p>Thu, 12 Sep 2019</p>
<p>“The new world picture, as it turned out, consciously and unconsciously drew on the machine as an organizing principle. The answer to the cultural upheavals, then, was to build institutions that would generate consensus not through the arduous work of contesting and resolving differences, but by automating the public realm and cultivating subjects qua citizens that would be willing to buy into the validity of ‘objective facts,’ neutral institutions, etc.</p>
<p>“In short, modernity was built upon a myth: the myth of neutrality or objectivity—neutral facts, neutral procedures, neutral institutions, neutral technology. It was this myth, wielded as a weapon against all manner of superstitions, that sustained the ideals of ‘Reason,’ ‘Progress,’ the ‘Rational Actor,’ etc. Reader: It, too, was a superstition.“—<a href="https://tinyletter.com/lmsacasas/letters/the-convivial-society-no-22">L.

<h2 id="appearance-and-reality">Appearance and Reality</h2>
<p>Mon, 16 Sep 2019</p>
<p>“Is there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no reasonable man could doubt it? This question, which at first sight might not seem difficult, is really one of the most difficult that can be asked. When we have realized the obstacles in the way of a straightforward and confident answer, we shall be well launched on the study of philosophy﻿—for philosophy is merely the attempt to answer such ultimate questions, not carelessly and dogmatically, as we do in ordinary life and even in the sciences, but critically, after exploring all that makes such questions puzzling, and after realizing all the vagueness and confusion that underlie our ordinary ideas.</p>
<p>“In daily life, we assume as certain many things which, on a closer scrutiny, are found to be so full of apparent contradictions that only a great amount of thought enables us to know what it is that we really may believe. In the search for certainty, it is natural to begin with our present experiences, and in some sense, no doubt, knowledge is to be derived from them. But any statement as to what it is that our immediate experiences make us know is very likely to be wrong. It seems to me that I am now sitting in a chair, at a table of a certain shape, on which I see sheets of paper with writing or print. By turning my head I see out of the window buildings and clouds and the sun. I believe that the sun is about ninety-three million miles from the earth; that it is a hot globe many times bigger than the earth; that, owing to the earth’s rotation, it rises every morning, and will continue to do so for an indefinite time in the future. I believe that, if any other normal person comes into my room, he will see the same chairs and tables and books and papers as I see, and that the table which I see is the same as the table which I feel pressing against my arm. All this seems to be so evident as to be hardly worth stating, except in answer to a man who doubts whether I know anything. Yet all this may be reasonably doubted, and all of it requires much careful discussion before we can be sure that we have stated it in a form that is wholly true.”—Bertrand Russell, <em>The Problems of Philosophy</em></p>

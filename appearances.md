# INTRODUCTION

There may be times when what is most needed is, not so much a new discovery or a new idea as a different &lsquo;slant&rsquo;; I mean a comparatively slight readjustment in our way of looking at the things and ideas on which attention is already fixed.

Draw a rectangular glass box in perspective&mdash;not too precise perspective (for the receding lines must be kept parallel, instead of converging)&mdash;and look at it. It has a front and a back, a top and a bottom. But slide your hand across it in the required direction and look again: you may find that what you thought was the inside of the top has become its outside, while th eoutside of the front wall has changed to the inside of the back wall, and vice versa. The visual readjustment was slight, for the box has not only turned inside out but is also lying at quite a different angle.

The book which follows has been written in the belief that it might be possible to slide a sort of hand across a good many of the things and ideas upon which the attention of western humanity has been concerned for the last two or three huindred years, and upon which the attention of the East is rapidly becoming fixed in the same way. The helping &lsquo.;hand&rsquo; which it has been sought to apply in this way is, simply, a *sustained* acceptance by the reader of the relation assumed by physical science to subsist between human consciousness on the onw hand and, on the other, the familiar world of which that consciousness is aware.

Physical science has for a long time stressed the enormous difference between what it investigates as the actual structure of the universe, including the earth, and the phenomena, or appearances, which are presented by that structure to normal human consciousness. In tune with this, most philosophy&mdash;at all events since Kant&mdash;has heavily emphasized the participation of man*rsquo;s own mind in the creation, or evocation, of these phenomena. The first three short chapters are largely devoted to reminding the reader of that difference and that participation.

About this conception of the relation between man and nature, which is wholly undisputed outside academic philosophy and largely undisputed within it, two things are noticeable; though they do not appear as yet to have been very widely noticed. One is an omission and the other an assumption.

In the first place, undisputed though it remains, it is (if we except a certain school of genetic psychology, now very much out of fashion) always left out of account is our spproach to any subject outside the sphere of physics&mdash;such subjects, for example, as the history of the earch, the history of language, the history of thought. In the second place, it is invariably assumed that, whatever the truth may be about the psychological nexus between man and nature, it is an unchanging one and is the same now as it was when men first appeared on earch.

In this book it is suggested that the assumption arose in the first place through clearly traceable historical causes; that the evidence is in favour of regarding it as illusory; and that its persistence in spite of that evidence is largely due to the omission.

As to the omission: having established the gulf which yawns between the atomic physical structure of nature and the appearances of the familiar world, it is of course possible, it is certainly usual&mdash;if we are physicists, to continue undisturbed with our investigations of the unappearing atomic structure, and, if we are philosophers, to leave it at that, being content with the metaphysical curiosity we have produced. It is usual; but it is not really necessary to do so. We could, if we chose, take it seriously; we could keep the gulf steadily in sight, instead of instantly forgetting all about it agian, and see what effect that has on our knowledge of other things, such as the evolution of nature and of man himself. Nor does this seem an unreasonable undertaking, since thesee are both matters, and the relation between them is a matter, to which the participation mentioned four paragraphs back must be at least relevant.

The greater part of this book consists, in fact, of a rudimentary attempt to remedy the omission. But this involves, as already indicated, challenging the assumption; and a good deal of attention has been devoted to that aspect also. The result&mdash;and really the substance of the book&mdash;is a sort of outline sketch, with one or two parts completed in greater detail, for a history of human consciousness; particularly the consciousness of western humanity during the last three thousand years or so.

Finally, the consequences which flow from abandoning the assumption are found to be very far-reaching; and the last three chapters are concerned, theologically, with the bearing of &lsquo;participation&rsquo;&mdash;viewed now as an historical process&mdash;upon the origin, the predicament, and the destiny of man.

# I<br/>THE RAINBOW

Look at a rainbow. While it lasts, it is, or appears to be, a great arc of many colors occupying a position out there in space. It touches the horizon between that chimney and that tree; a line drawn from the sun behind you and passing through your head would pierce the center of the circle of which it is part. And now, before it fades, recollect all you have ever been told about the rainbow and its causes, and ask yourself the question *Is it really there?*

You know, from memory, that if there were a hillside three or four miles nearer than the present horizon, The rainbow would come to earth in front of and not behind it; That, if you walk to the place where the rainbow ends, or seems to end, it would certainly not be &lsquo;there&rsquo;. In a word, reflection will assure you that the rainbow is the outcome of the sun, the raindrops and your own vision.

When I ask of an intelligible appearance or representation, Is it really there? I usually mean, Is it there independently of my vision? Would it still be there for instance, If I shut my eyes&mdash;if I moved towards or away from it. If this is what you also mean by &ldquo;really there&rdquo;, you will be tempted to add that the raindrops and the sun are really there, but the rainbow is not.

Does it follow that, as soon as anybody sees a rainbow, there &lsquo;is&rsquo; one, or, in other words, that there is no difference between an hallucination or a madman&rsquo;s dream of a rainbow (perhaps on a clear day) and an actual rainbow? Certainly not. You were not the only one to see that rainbow. You had a friend with you. (I forbear asking if you both saw &lsquo;the same&rsquo; rainbow, because this is a book about history rather than metaphysics, and these introductory chapters are merely intended to clear away certain misconceptions.) Moreover, through the medium of language, you are well aware that thousands of others have seen rainbows in showery weather; but you have never heard of any sane person claiming to ahve seen one on a sunless or a cloudless day. Therefore, if a man tells you he sees a rainbow on a cloudless day, then, even if you are convinced that he means what he says, and is not simply lying, you will confidently affirm that the rainbow he sees is &lsquo;not there&rsquo;.

In short, as far as being really there or not is concerned, the practical difference between a dream or hallucination of a rainbow and an actual rainbow is that, although each is a  representation or appearance (that is, something which I perceive to be there), the second is a *shared* or collective representation.

Now look at a tree. It is very different from a rainbow. If you approach it, it will still be &lsquo;there&rsquo;. Moreover, in this case, you can do more than look at it. You can hear the noise its leaves make in the wind. You can perhaps smell it. You can certainly touch it. Your senses combine to assure you that it is composed of what is called solid matter. Accord to the tree the same treatment that you accorded to the rainbow. Recollect all you have been told about matter and its ultimate structure and ask yourself if the tree is &lsquo;really there&rsquo;. I am far from affirming dogmatically that the atoms, electrons, nuclei, etc., of which wood, and all matter, is said to be composed, are particular and identifiable objects like drops of rain. But if the &lsquo;particles&rsquo; (as I will here call them for convenience) *are* there, and are all that is there, then, since the &slquo;particles&rsquo; are no more like the thing I call a rainbow, it follows, I think, that&mdash;just as a rainbow is the outcome of the raindrops and my vision&mdash;so, a tree is the outcome of the particles and my vision and my other sense-perceptions. Whatever the particles themselves may be thought to be, the tree, as such, is a representation. And the difference, for me, between a tree and a complete hallucination of a tree is the same as the difference between a rainbow and an hallucination of a rainbow. In other words, a tree which is &lsquo;really there&rsquo; is a collective representation. The fact that a dream tree differs in kind from a real tree, and that it is just silly to try and mix them up, is indeed rather literally a matter of &lsquo;common sense&rsquo;.

This background of particles is of course presumed in the case of raindrops themselves, no less than in that of trees. The relation, *raindrops: rainbows*, is a picture or analogy, not an instance, of the relation, *particles: representation*.

Or again, if anyone likes to press the argument still further and maintain that what is true of the drops must also be true of the particles themselves, and that there is &lsquo;no such thing as an extra-mental reality&rsquo;, I shall not quarrel with him, but I shall leave him severely alone; because, as I say, this is not a book about metaphysics, and I have no desire to demonstrate that trees or rainbows&mdash;or particles&mdash;are not &lsquo;really there&rsquo;&mdash;a proposition which perhaps has not much meaning. This book is not being written because the author desires to put forward a theory of perception, but because it seems to him that certain wide consequences flowing from the hastily expanded sciences of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and in particular their physics, have not been sufficiently considered in building up the general twentieth-century picture of the nature of the universe and of the history of the earth and man.

A better term than &lsquo;particles&rsquo; would possibly be &lsquo;the unrepresented&rsquo;, since anything particular which amounts to a representation will always attract further physical analysis. Moreover, the atoms, protons and electrons of modern physics are now perhaps more generally regarded, not as particles, but as notional models or symbols of an unknown supersensible or subsensible base. All I seek to establish in these opening paragraphs is, that, whatever may be thought about the &lsquo;unrepresented&rsquo; background of our perceptions, the *familiar* world which we see and know around us&mdash;the blue sky with white clouds in it, the noise of a waterfall or a motor-bus, the shapes of flowers and their scent, the gesture and utterance of animals and the faces of our friends&mdash;the world too, which (apart from the special inquiry of physics) experts of all kinds methodically investigate&mdash;is a system of collective representations. The time comes when one must either accept this as the truth about the world or rejecct the theories of physics as an elaborate delusion. We cannot have it both ways.

# II<br/>COLLECTIVE REPRESENTATIONS

A representation is something I percieve to be there. By premising that the everyday world is a system of collective representations, it may be thought that we blur the distinction between the fancied and the actual or, following the everyday use of language, between the apparently there and the really there. But this is not so. It only seems to be so because of the very great emphasis which—especially in the last three or four hundred years—the Western Mind has come to lay on the ingredient of spatial depth in the total complex of its perception. I shall return to this later.

As to what is meant by ‘collective’—any discrepancy between my representations and those of my fellow men raises a presumption of unreality and calls for explanation. If, however, the explanation is satisfactory; if, for instance, it turns out that the discrepancy was due, not to my hallucination, but to the myopia or their dullness, it is likely to be accepted; and then my representation may itself end by becoming collective.

It is, however, not necessary to maintain that collectivity is the *only* test for distinguishing between a representation and a collective representation (though, to creatures for whom insanity is round the corner, it is often likely to be the crucial one).

I am hit violently on the head and, in the same moment, perceive a bright light to be there. Later on I reflect that the light was ‘not really there’, even if I had lived all my life on a desert island where there was no-one to compare notes with, I might do as much. No doubt I should learn by experience to distinguish the first kind of light from the more practicable light of day or the thunderbolt, and should soon give up hitting myself on the head at sunset when I needed light to go on working by. In both cases I perceive light, but the various criteria of difference between them—duration, for instance, and a sharp physical pain, which the one involves and the other does not, are not difficult to apprehend.

What is required, is not to go on stressing the resemblance between collective representations and private representations, but to remember, when we leave the world of everyday for the discipline of any strict inquiry, that, *if* the particles, or the unrepresented, are in face all that is *independently* there, then the world we all accept as real is in fact a system of collective representations.

Perception takes place by means of sense-organs, through the ingredient in it of sensation, experienced as such, varies greatly as between the different senses.

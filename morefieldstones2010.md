## Giving and Forgiving
Tue, 12 Oct 2010 07:45:00

If you have ill will toward any, if you are prejudiced against any, if you have accused any even in your silent thought, of injustice, or if you have criticised any one, sit down alone at night before retiring and mentally ask him to forgive you. Calling him by name, silently confess to him what you have done, and ask his forgiveness, telling him as you do the others, over and over again, that you love him, and are sure there is nothing but God&rsquo;s perfect Love between you. Never retire until you have thus definitely &ldquo;cleaned up the slate&rdquo; between yourself and every other human being, having definitely forgiven---given love for---every one. Keep at this until all the tightened cords which have been cutting off the free flow of God&rsquo;s love and life through you are loosened; until a habit of forgiving is established within you.&mdash;H. Emilie Cady (God a Present Help)

## Science
Sun, 12 Dec 2010 23:32:02

We approach the subject (prayer) in a spirit of scientific enquiry. The question to be asked is not what according to our theology God ought to do, but what He actually does. -- Lewis Maclachlan

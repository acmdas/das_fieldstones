<h2 id="consciousness">Consciousness</h2>
<p>Monday, 13 January 2020</p>
<p>“Consciousness is never experienced in the plural, only in the singular. Not only has none of us ever experienced more than one consciousness, but there is also no trace of circumstantial evidence of this ever happening anywhere in the world. If I say that there cannot be more than one consciousness in the same mind, this seems a blunt tautology–we are quite unable to imagine the contrary.”—Erwin Schrödinger (unattributed)</p>
<h2 id="mere">Mere</h2>
<p>Monday, 13 January 2020</p>
<p>“But my interest was drawn not only to the noun in the title of Bejan’s book but also to the adjective: mere. Her use of that word delighted me. Like a lover of endangered species, the lover of endangered words jumps for joy when he sees a word being rescued, and is grateful when a writer restores to currency a semantic possibility that had fallen into desuetude. It is as if a lovely antique table has been rediscovered after many years of gathering dust up in the attic, and when brought downstairs and cleaned up and polished, imparts a splendor and unbought grace to the room that no shiny new object could possibly match.”—<a href="https://hedgehogreview.com/issues/eating-and-being/articles/mere">Wilfred M. McClay</a></p>
<h2 id="truth">Truth</h2>
<p>Saturday, 11 January 2020</p>
<p>“Truth is not that which is demonstrable but that which is unavoidable.”—Antoine de Saint-Exupery</p>
<h2 id="committment">Committment</h2>
<p>Saturday, 11 January 2020</p>
<p>“At the moment of commitment the entire universe conspires to assist you.”—Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe</p>
<h2 id="choosing-evil">Choosing Evil</h2>
<p>Saturday, 11 January 2020</p>
<p>“No man chooses evil because it is evil; he only mistakes it for happiness, the good he seeks.”—Mary Wollstonecraft</p>
<h2 id="precision">Precision</h2>
<p>Saturday, 11 January 2020</p>
<p>“There’s no sense in being precise when you don’t even know what you’re talking about”—John Von Neumann (unsourced)</p>
<h2 id="expression">Expression</h2>
<p>Saturday, 11 January 2020</p>
<p>“I know more than I can express in words, and the little I can express would not have been expressed, had I not known more.”—Vladimir Nabokov, <em>Strong Opinions</em></p>
<h2 id="anger">Anger</h2>
<p>Saturday, 11 January 2020</p>
<p>“To be angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, in the right way—that is not easy.”—Aristotle, <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em></p>
<h2 id="editing">Editing</h2>
<p>Wednesday, 08 January 2020</p>
<p>“A simple editing trick:</p>
<p>“Every sentence has a purpose. It doesn’t exist to take up space. It exists to change the reader, to move her from here to there.</p>
<p>“This sentence, then, what’s it for?</p>
<p>“If it doesn’t move us closer to where we seek to go, delete it.”—<a href="https://seths.blog/2020/01/what-is-this-sentence-supposed-to-do/">Seth Godin</a></p>
<h2 id="madness">Madness</h2>
<p>Saturday, 04 January 2020</p>
<p>“Madness is rare in individuals—but in groups, parties, nations, and ages it is the rule.”—Nietzche</p>
<h2 id="muggeridges-law">Muggeridge’s Law</h2>
<p>Thursday, 02 January 2020</p>
<p>“Satire can never compete with real life for its sheer absurdity.”</p>
<p>“While Malcolm Muggeridge was the editor of Punch, it was announced that Khrushchev and Bulganin were coming to England. Muggeridge hit upon the idea of a mock itinerary, a lineup of the most ludicrous places the two paunchy pear-shaped little Soviet leaders could possibly be paraded through during the solemn process of a state visit. Shortly before press time, half the feature had to be scrapped. It coincided exactly with the official itinerary, just released, prompting Muggeridge to observe: We live in an age in which it is no longer possible to be funny. There is nothing you can imagine, no matter how ludicrous, that will not promptly be enacted before your very eyes, probably by someone well known.”—Tom Wolfe, “Stalking the Billion-Footed Beast: A literary manifesto for the new social novel”, <em>Harpers</em>, November, 1989</p>
<h2 id="sowells-law">Sowell’s Law</h2>
<p>Thursday, 02 January 2020prin</p>
<p>“In human problems, there are no solutions, only trade-offs.”</p>
<h2 id="sumners-law">Sumner’s Law</h2>
<p>Thursday, 02 January 2020</p>
<p>“The type and formula of most schemes of philanthropy or humanitarianism is this: A and B put their heads together to decide what C shall be made to do for D. The radical vice of all these schemes, from a sociological point of view, is that C is not allowed a voice in the matter, and his position, character, and interests, as well as the ultimate effects on society through C’s interests, are entirely overlooked. […A and B] ignore entirely the source from which they must draw all the energy which they employ in their remedies, and they ignore all the effects on other members of society than the ones they have in view. […T]he State cannot get a cent for any man without taking it from some other man, and this latter must be a man [C] who has produced and saved it. This latter is the Forgotten Man.”—William Graham Sumner, <em>The Forgotten Man</em></p>
<h2 id="heinleins-dichotomy">Heinlein’s Dichotomy</h2>
<p>Thursday, 02 January 2020</p>
<p>“Political rags—such as royalist, communist, democrat, populist, fascist, liberal, conservative, and so forth—are never basic criteria. The human race divides politically into those who want people to be controlled and those who have no such desire.”—Robert A. Heinlein <em>The notebooks of Lazarus Long</em></p>
<h2 id="cognitive-bias">Cognitive Bias</h2>
<p>Thursday, 02 January 2020</p>
<p>“Intelligent and educated people are less likely to learn from their mistakes, for instance, or take advice from others. And when they do err, they are better able to build elaborate arguments to justify their reasoning, meaning that they become more and more dogmatic in their views.”—David Robson, <em>The Intelligence Trap</em></p>
<h2 id="dysrationalia">Dysrationalia</h2>
<p>Thursday, 02 January 2020</p>
<p>“We have an implicit [but wrong] assumption that intelligence and rationality go together—or else why would we be so surprised when smart people do foolish things?”</p>
<p>“I coined the term “dysrationalia” (analogous to “dyslexia”), meaning the inability to think and behave rationally despite having adequate intelligence, to draw attention to a large domain of cognitive life that intelligence tests fail to assess.”—<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rational-and-irrational-thought-the-thinking-that-iq-tests-miss/">Keith E. Stanovich</a></p>
<h2 id="practice-it">Practice It</h2>
<p>Wednesday, 01 January 2020</p>
<p>“The Games sacred to Zeus were held every four years at the city of Olympia in Greece. The stadium is still there. You can walk through the tunnel that the athletes took to enter the arena and even wriggle your toes into the stone grooves that served in ancient times as starting blocks for the races.</p>
<p>“In those days, the spectators sat city-by-city. The Athenians took their seats all in one section. Same for the Corinthians, Argives, etc.</p>
<p>”The stadium was packed on this particular day, when an elderly gentleman entered seeking a seat.</p>
<p>“No one would get up for him.</p>
<p>“The old man crossed painfully through the Theban section. Nobody stood. The gentleman next entered the Achaean section; again no person vacated his seat. By now the full stadium had noticed the elderly fellow’s ordeal. They began jeering and mocking him. The man worked his way through the sections of two more cities. Still no one stood. The laughter and derision now dominated the entire field.</p>
<p>“The old man next stepped toward the Spartan section. As soon as his foot crossed the margin, every single Spartan stood, offering the gentleman his seat.</p>
<p>“At this, the entire stadium burst into applause. The ovation lasted for minutes. When the cheers finally died down, one spectator turned to his neighbor and observed, ‘See? The Greeks all know what is right. But only the Spartans practice it.’”—<a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2020/01/2-notes-for-the-new-year/">Steven Pressfield</a></p>

<p><em>The Rediscovery of Meaning and other essays</em>. Wesleyan University Press, 1977, pp 33-43</p>
<p>We call a sentence “literal” when it means what it affirms on the face of it, and nothing else. If some sentences are not literal, that is because it is possible, by recognized linguistic usage, to affirm or express one thing and to mean another thing, either instead of or as well as the first. An extreme case of meaning another thing instead (which I will call “substituted meaning”) is the prearranged code. In P.G. Wodehouse’s <em>Leave it to Psmith</em>, a young man outside an Underground Station goes up to a number of complete strangers in turn and tells them to their surprise (and sometimes annoyance) that “There will be rain in Northumberland tomorrow.” But what he really means is: “Are you the person who advertised in the Personal Column and later wrote asking me to meet you here?” Perhaps the code is hardly a <em>linguistic</em> device; but it will serve as a kind of marker for the terminal point of “substitution”; and we may profitably compare with it the <em>cliché</em>, or completely <em>fossilized metaphor</em>. If, for example, I tell anyone to “leave no stone unturned,” there is hardly more of “stone” in my meaning than there was of “rain” in Psmith’s. All that is left is the substituted meaning: “Try every way you can think of!”</p>
<p>When we turn from “instead of” to “as well as,” that is, to sentences which convey a secondary meaning, while still in some measure retaining the primary, or literal, one (I will call this “concomitant meaning”), we have already crossed the frontier between prose and poetry. At least I think our examples would practically all have to be taken from among sentences which are characteristically—though not necessarily successfully—poetic. They would range from allegory at one end of the scale, where the two meanings continue alongside, on more or less parallel lines, to</p>

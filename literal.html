<h2 id="owen-barfield">Owen Barfield</h2>
<p><em>The Rediscovery of Meaning and other essays</em>. Wesleyan University Press, 1977, pp 33-43</p>
<p>We call a sentence “literal” when it means what it affirms on the face of it, and nothing else. If some sentences are not literal, that is because it is possible, by recognized linguistic usage, to affirm or express one thing and to mean another thing, either instead of or as well as the first. An extreme case of meaning another thing instead (which I will call “substituted meaning”) is the prearranged code.</p>

<h2 id="hiding-from-the-mission">Hiding from the mission</h2>
<p>Sun, 07 Jan 2018 20:13:07</p>
<p>We do this in two ways: The first is refusing to be clear and precise about what the mission is. Avoiding specifics about what we hope to accomplish and for whom. Being vague about success and (thus about failure).</p>
<p>After all, if no one knows exactly what the mission is, it’s hard feel like a failure if it doesn’t succeed.</p>
<p>The second is even more insidious. We degrade the urgency of the mission. We become diffuse. We get distracted. Anything to avoid planting a stake and saying, “I made this.”</p>
<p>It’s possible to spend 7 hours and 52 minutes out of an eight-hour day in doing nothing but hiding from the mission. And it’s exhausting. <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2018/01/hiding-from-the-mission.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Seth Godin</a></p>

<p>Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:35:47</p>
<p>“Because God is not a finite object over against you as a subject, you cannot simply turn away towards ‘something else.”; He is the ground and end of all desire and knowledge as such, the Good in itself. You cannot choose or not choose God the way you would choose or not choose a cup of coffee. You desire anything because of your original desire for God as the transcendental Good and Beautiful; you know anything because of your original intellectual appetite for God as the transcendental Truth as such. Even in desiring to flee God, you are desiring God as the ‘good end” you seek in godlessness. He is inescapable because all being, goodness, unity, truth, and beauty simply are God in their transcendent truth, and because a rational nature is nothing but an infinite dynamic orientation towards that transcendent end. The natural will, as Maximus says, can will only God. Don’t think of God as a candidate in a political race, whom you could simply reject and be done with; he is the original and final act of your every discrete act of desire. And, in the ages, since God is all and there is literally nothing beyond him, the natural will is always seeking its natural supernatural end. Simply said, God is not an object of desire; he is the end that makes desire.”—<a href="https://afkimel.wordpress.com/essential-readings-on-universalism/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">David Bentley Hart</a></p>
<h2 id="being-christian">Being Christian</h2>
<p>Wed, 10 Jan 2018 23:38:35</p>
<p>“It is almost universally assumed today that becoming a Christian means in essence the adoption of a new set of beliefs or the initiation of a new mode of behaviour. A Christian would be defined as one who ‘believes in Christ’ or ‘worships Christ’ or ‘tries to follow Christ’s teaching.’ Now it is far from my purpose to belittle either Christian dogma or Christian ethics. Nevertheless, it must be pointed out that to define the essence of Christianity in terms of belief or of practice involves the neglect of two principles that are fundamental to all sound theology. The former of these is that the act of God precedes and is presupposed by the acts of man: ‘Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us’; ‘Ye have come to know God, <em>or rather to be known of God</em>.’ The second is that what a being <em>is</em> precedes what it <em>does</em>; our actions are a consequence of what we are <em>operari sequitur esse</em>. It will follow from this that the Christian should be defined not in terms of what he himself does, but of what God has made him to be. Being a Christian is an ontological fact, resulting from an act of God.”—E. L. Mascall, <em>Christ, the Christian, and the Church</em> p.77</p>
<h2 id="meditation-for-january-15">Meditation for January 15</h2>
<p>Mon, 15 Jan 2018 17:34:22</p>
<p>I will relax and not get tense. I will have no fear, because everything will work out in the end. I will learn soul-balance and poise in a vacillating, changing world. I will claim God’s power and use it because if I do not use it, it will be withdrawn. As long as I get back to God and replenish my strength after each task, no work can be too much. Prayer for the Day I pray that I may relax and that God’s strength will be given to me. I pray that I may subject my will to God’s will and be free from all tenseness.

<p>Tue, 23 Jan 2018 03:46:50</p>
<p>“What did Jesus want to say to us? What does he want from us today? How does he help us to be faithful Christians today? It is not ultimately important to us what this or that church leader wants. Rather, we want to know what Jesus wants. When we go to hear a sermon, his own word is what we want to hear. This matters to us not only for our own sakes, but also for all those who have become estranged from the church and its message. It is also our opinion that if Jesus himself and Jesus alone with his word were among us in our preaching, then quite a different set of people would hear the word and quite a different set of people would again turn away from it.”—Dietrich Bonhoeffer, <em>The Cost of Discipleship</em></p>

<p>“A man, walking through the forest saw a fox that had lost its legs, and wondered how it lived. Then he saw a tiger come up with game in its mouth. The tiger ate its fill and left the rest of the meat for the fox. The next day God fed the fox by means of the same tiger.”The man began to wonder at God’s greatness and said to himself, ‘I too shall just rest in a corner with full trust in the Lord and He will provide me with all I need.’ “He did this for many days, but nothing happened, and he was almost at death’s door when he heard a voice say, ‘O you who are in the path of error, open your eyes to the truth! Stop imitating the disabled fox and follow the example of the tiger’”—Ernie Kurtz</p>

<p>“A great deal of false history was written, by people who never strayed north of London, about working-class hardship in those parts. Yes, there was plenty, but what we get from the entrepreneurs of socialism is twisted to their agitprop needs. Rewriting the history, to make it more true, makes another nice hobby; and in the course of it we discover that the ugliest of the capitalists often did less damage than the philanthropists.”—<a href="https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2018/02/16/as-the-world-turns-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">David Warren</a></p>

<p>Turning and turning in the widening gyre The falcon cannot hear the falconer; Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere The ceremony of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction, while the worst Are full of passionate intensity. Surely some revelation is at hand; Surely the Second Coming is at hand. The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out<br />
When a vast image out of <em>Spiritus Mundi</em> Troubles my sight: a waste of desert sand;<br />
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,<br />
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,<br />
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it<br />
Wind shadows of the indignant desert birds.<br />
The darkness drops again; but now I know<br />
That twenty centuries of stony sleep Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,<br />
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,<br />
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born? — William Butler Yeats, 1919</p>

<blockquote>
I have a theory about the Hero’s Journey. We all have one. We have many, in fact. But our primary hero’s journey as artists is the passage we live out, in real life, before we find our calling. The hero’s journey is the search for that calling. It’s preparation. It’s initiation (or more precisely, self-initiation). On the hero’s journey, we see, we experience, we suffer. We learn. On our hero’s journey, we acquire a history that is ours alone. It’s a secret history, a private history, a personal history. No one has it but us. No one knows it but us. This secret history is the most valuable possession we hold, or ever will hold. We will draw upon it for the rest of our lives. The hero’s journey ends when, like Odysseus, we return home to Ithaca, to the place from which we started. We wash up on shore. We have survived. We have come home. Now what?

<p>Well, what? There’s a calling, that calling, the one that’s mysteriously been whispering and talking and yelling and screaming obscenities at you/me all along. Only now, it’s explicit. It’s there, not “out there” but “right there” and there’s some question but not much and not enough to put it off anymore. Now what? It’s been a long, strange trip, and it isn’t over. Hell, it’s not much more than just started. Now what?</p>

<h2 id="projectionempathy">Projection/Empathy</h2>
<p>Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:06:03</p>
<blockquote>
The monologue that runs in our brain is loud. It’s heavy-metal loud compared to the quiet signals we get from the rest of the world. All day, every day, that noise keeps going. It’s the only voice that has seen everything we’ve seen, believes everything we believe. It’s the noise that not only criticizes every action of every other person who disagrees with us, but it criticizes their motives as well. And, if we question it, it criticizes us as well. Is it any wonder that projection is more powerful than empathy? When we meet people, we either celebrate when they agree with us or plot to change or ignore them when they don’t. There’s not a lot of room for, “they might have a different experience of this moment than I do.” That noise in our head is selfish, afraid and angry. That noise is self-satisfied, self-important and certain. That noise pushes intimacy away and will do anything it can to degrade those that might challenge us. But, against all odds, empathy is possible. It’s possible to amplify those too-quiet signals that others send us and to practice imagining, even for a moment, what it might be like to have their noise instead of our noise. If we put in the effort and devote the time to practice this skill, we can get better at it. We merely have to begin.

<p>“War, by imposing hardships and controls on daily life, produces an aggressive mentality and degrades people’s character according to their wretched conditions. The result in this case was a general state of public disorder in all countries. As time went on and the earlier atrocities became an accepted fact, the later ones were marked by refinements of technique and novel methods of retaliation. Even words lost their proper meanings and were changed to suit current propaganda . . . . family ties were broken for the sake of party loyalty. . . . Relations between people were governed not by the security of established customs but by the prospect of selfish gain in defiance of the law.” Does this sound familiar? Is this an apt description of our lifetime and that of our parents (or grandparents, that Greatest Generation)?

<h2 id="authoritative">Authoritative</h2>
<p>Mon, 19 Mar 2018 14:42:13</p>
Christianity has projected Jesus as the long-suffering, meek, and gentle “lamb of God.” The Gospels present another picture: Gentle and compassionate, yes, but the Jesus of these pages is predominantly strong, candid, and above all <em>authoritative</em>. As Harold points out:
<blockquote>
At the time, people did not marvel so much at what Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount as at the <em>authority</em> with which He spoke:
<blockquote>
“…the people were astonished at his doctrine; for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.”
</blockquote>
Today, “scribes” have rewritten these words. In <em>The New English Bible</em>, read the translation thirteen scholars offer to men whose souls are starved, and scared, and scarred—it is a timid bit:
<blockquote>
“. . . he taught with a note of authority.”
</blockquote>
The translators write in the tenor of their age—a “note” of faith in anything, a “note” of authority in anything, is all that is left. But because of this, the twentieth century is a time pregnant with the possibility of grasping truth, for now man must seek the authority within himself.

<p>Tue, 20 Mar 2018 21:25:14</p>
<p>Every human being, if he lives his normal span, suffers five traumatic events that serve to expand his consciousness and increase his need to know the truth of himself in being: the trauma of birth, of puberty, of recognizing himself to be cast out in solitary being, of losing his sexual competency, of anticipating the loss of his life. Thus, built into his nature are the stresses that periodically “flood the cellar” of his subconscious mind and free him of much of the “conditioned learning” society and Babel Tower builders have imposed upon him. Therefore, before death overtakes him, he is free of much of his spurious “conditioning.”—Preston Harold, <em>The Shining Stranger</em>, p. 95</p>

<p>Fri, 23 Mar 2018 20:04:09</p>
<p>In man, empathy, not conscience, is the resonator. But conscience has a vital role to play. Just as a satellite must have a continuous sensing of its motion and attitude in space, keeping itself horizontal in relation to the surface of the earth below if it is to perform its complicated maneuvers, so man must have a continuous sense of “right or wrong,” regardless of the compassion his empathy arouses within him as he views good or evil in this world. Conscience, which is of the closed world of the past, acts as an “inertial reference package” to balance the course empathy takes.—Preston Harold, <em>The Shining Stranger</em>, p. 161</p>

<p>“Saint Luke was a painter, by some accounts, and by others a physician. I think he was both, and more, from acquaintance with his writings. But certainly a physician. When Matthew and Mark recount the saying of Jesus, that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to pass through the gates of heaven, they use the Greek term for a household sewing needle. But Luke instinctively uses the term for a surgeon’s suturing needle.

That is, a lot of the things that I do, that most people do, are because they hate something somebody else has done, or they hate that something hasn’t been done. And I realized that informed criticism has completely been done in by the web. Because the web has produced so much uninformed criticism. It’s kind of a Gresham’s Law—bad money drives the good money out of circulation. Bad criticism drives good criticism out of circulation. You just can’t criticize anything.”—Alan Kay <a href="https://vimeo.com/10260548" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>How Simply and Understandably Could The ‘Personal Computing Experience’ Be Programmed?</em></a></p>
<h2 id="the-language-of-nature">The Language of Nature</h2>
<p>Thu, 31 May 2018 12:36:41</p>
<p>“We must remember that Galileo merely said that the language of nature is written in mathematics. He did not say everything is. And even the truth about nature need not be expressed in mathematics. For most of human history, the language of nature has been the language of myth and ritual. These forms, one might add, had the virtues of leaving nature unthreatened and of encouraging the belief that human beings are part of it. It hardly befits a people who stand ready to blow up the planet to praise themselves too vigorously for having found the true way to talk about nature.” &amp;mdash: Neil Postman <em>Amusing Ourselves to Death</em></p>
<h2 id="powercorruption">Power/Corruption</h2>
<p>Thu, 31 May 2018 12:47:53</p>
<p>“‘Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.’ We’ve all seen this quote of Lord Acton. Most people agree with it. I don’t. Like many (if not most) great quotes, it is dead wrong. Why? Because it’s exactly backwards, that’s why…</p>
<p>“Let’s reconstruct Acton’s sentence in a way that reflects the truth of the matter (and energy) of power. Put the word ‘man’ in place of ‘power’, and then move the word ‘power’ behind the word ‘corrupt(s)’. Now let’s see what it should look like if we’re truly seeking the truth: ‘(Man) tends to corrupt power, and absolute (Man) corrupts power absolutely’.”—Ianto Watt <a href="http://wmbriggs.com/post/24549/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Lord Acton’s Apostasy</em></a></p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Sat, 02 Jun 2018 11:48:39</p>
<p>“The problem is no longer getting people to express themselves, but providing little gaps of solitude and silence in which they might eventually find something to say. Repressive forces don’t stop people from expressing themselves, but rather, force them to express themselves. What a relief to have nothing to say, the right to say nothing, because only then is there a chance of framing the rare, or ever rarer, the thing that might be worth saying.”—Gilles Deleuze</p>
<h2 id="joyces-reality">Joyce's Reality</h2>
<p>Mon, 18 Jun 2018 11:07:32</p>
<p>"Beckett wrote that Joyce believed fervently in the significance of chance events and of random connections.</p>
<p>‘To Joyce reality was a paradigm, an illustration of a possibly unstateable rule… According to this rule, reality, no matter how much we try to manipulate it, can only shift about in continual movement, yet movement limited in its possibilities…’ giving rise to ‘the notion of the world where unexpected simultaneities are the rule.’ In other words, a coincidence such as sitting down to dinner with James Joyce is actually just part of a continually moving pattern, like a kaleidoscope. Or Joyce likes to put it, a ‘collideorscape’”.—Gabrielle Carey <em><a href="https://sydneyreviewofbooks.com/breaking-james-joyce/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Breaking Up With James Joyce</a></em> <a href="http://www.consultingsmiths.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MarxRealith.jpg"><img src="http://www.consultingsmiths.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MarxRealith-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1024" /></a></p>

<p>Mon, 18 Jun 2018 11:27:48</p>
<p>“According to Ellman, Joyce’s view of sin was influenced by Hermann Suderman’s play Magda: ‘Magda’s philosophy of life may well have helped to shape Joyce’s. As she says, “And one thing more, my friend—sin! We must sin if we wish to grow. To become greater than our sins is worth more than all the purity you preach.””"—Gabrielle Carey <em><a href="https://sydneyreviewofbooks.com/breaking-james-joyce/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Breaking Up With James Joyce</a></em> Is the nature of reality binary, dual?

<p>“NO EVIL as such can be desirable, either by natural appetite or by conscious will. It is sought indirectly, namely because it is a consequence of some good. This is the rule for every type of appetite. A natural force works for a form, not the absence of form. Yet one form may extrude another.

He is not actually happy when free; he is uncomfortable, a bit alarmed, and intolerably lonely. Liberty is not a thing for the great masses of men.

The idea that man’s most fundamental nature is that of a homo economicus, a rational agent whose chief end is material possession, is the common basis of both economic liberalism or capitalism and socialism. At its heart it is a denial of the classical and Christian idea that man has a spiritual as well as a physical nature and that the spiritual ought to rule the animal nature. The idea that most or all of human suffering can be eliminated by reorganizing society economically, socially, and politically is rooted in the ancient heresy of Pelagianism for it is a denial of the fact that since the Fall, human nature itself has been afflicted with the flaw of Original Sin, which is the true source of all human suffering, an affliction for which there is no economic, social, or political cure.”—<a href="http://thronealtarliberty.blogspot.com/2018/09/assorted-reflections.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gerry T.

<p>"When the Church emerged from the catacombs after Constantine won the battle of the Milvan Bridge and the Church was no longer persecuted, there came freedom and, worse, respectability. So with this freedom came terrible danger, a danger that is now convulsing the Church, namely what might be called the Imperialization of the Latin West. The pagans poured into the Church. This was a new organization, albeit sacred, where future generations could climb the ladder to power and wealth.</p>
<p>From the moment that the Roman Church, and to a certain extent the Byzantine Church, took on the bureaucracy of the Roman Empire as a model for its working structures, there was a foothold for the Devil. In the hands of a Gregory the Great it was safe, but when popes, cardinals, and bishops became worldly and ambitious then there was more than a whiff of danger, there were darkness and a terrible thing. What was this terrible thing? It was nothing more and nothing less than the re-crucifying of Christ, not by out and out sinners such as gangsters, murderers, and heartless dictators, but by Popes, bishops, and cardinals, and by far, far too many priests infatuated with ambition, wealth, power, and sensuality.</p>
<p>We must reflect profoundly on the fact that the great St. John Chrysostom and the utterly gentle Robert Bellarmine thought that most bishops go to Hell. We priests are in no better state, as witnessed by that other great saint, Alphonsus Liguori, who said that most priests go to Hell. Today the great temptation among Catholics, and the mainstream Protestant churches, is the First Temptation of Christ; namely, to turn stones into bread. As long as we are involved solely in the social Gospel, then that is all that is needed. This Utopian style Christianity best incarnated in Liberation Theology is exactly what Christ speaks against, when Satan tempts Him to assuage his hunger by turning stones into bread. We must in our materialistic age reflect on Christ’s response to Satan, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God” (Matthew 4: 4 ). When we become engrossed on feeding and clothing the World’s population and getting everyone jobs, noble as this effort is, it is not enough. There is only one thing that is enough, and that is that we give ourselves totally and utterly to God, holding nothing back. However, because we are human most of us fail miserably, and before long there are programmes put into place that are anything but Christian.</p>

They are born for the solid earth, not for the water. And naturally they won’t think. They are made for life, not for thought.

Authority as opposed to mere power, how exactly to be defined? Its etymology: its relation to <em>auctor</em>. From these thoughts he was aroused by an expectant silence opposite him, and looking up he saw Dutourd and Vidal looking at him across the table, their forks poised: reaching back in his mind he caught the echo of a question: ‘What do you think of democracy?’</p>
<p>‘The gentleman was asking what you thought of democracy, sir,’ said Vidal, smiling.</p>
<p>‘Alas I cannot tell you, sir,’ said Stephen, returning the smile. ‘For although it would not be proper to call this barque or vessel a King’s ship except in the largest sense, we nevertheless adhere strictly to the naval tradition which forbids discussion of religion, women, or politics in our mess. It has been objected that this rule makes insipidity, which may be so; yet on the other hand it has it uses, since in this case for example it prevents any member from wounding any other gentleman present by saying that he did not think the policy that put Socrates to death and that left Athens prostrate was the highest expression of human wisdom, or by quoting Aristotle’s definition of democracy as mob rule, the depraved version of a commonwealth.’”—Patrick O’Brien, <em>The Wine-Dark Sea</em></p>

<p>“But if we scrutinize the men of the Middle Ages more closely, contrasting them with ourselves, we shall find something yet more significant. And it is this, that they identified <em>themselves</em> with their thoughts. This is of the utmost importance. It is this that is at the bottom of all that strikes a modern observer as most incomprehensible and alien about the men of that time—for example, their intolerance. Identifying the thought with the words, they felt that truth could be wholly embodied in creed and dogma, and identifying the self with the thought, they were—quite rightly—intolerant. A wrong thought could strike them as far more immoral than a wrong action.”—Owen Barfield <em>Romanticism Comes of Age</em> p. 54 An example of a key “Barfieldian” concept—that we are profoundly different from our ancestors, that their experience of both external and interior realities was incomprehensibly different from ours.</p>

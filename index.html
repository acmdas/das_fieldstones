    <h2>Audacity</h2>
    <p>April 13, 2019</p>
    <p>&ldquo;If you are inclined - late in life though it be - to reconnoitre
      a foreign sphere of limitless extent, then be persuaded that the first
      quality that is needed is Audacity. There really is no time for the
      deliberate approach...We must not be too ambitious. We cannot aspire to
      masterpieces. We may content ourselves with a joy ride. And for this
      Audacity is the only ticket.&rdquo; &mdash; W. S. Churchill &mdash;

    <h2>I Broke Two Bowls Today</h2>
    <p>April 12, 2019</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I was emptying the dishwasher, holding both small clean bowls in
      one hand. One of them slipped, and I watched, aghast, as it started to
      fall in slow motion toward the hard kitchen floor.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;In a valiant but vain attempt to miraculously catch the bowl, I
      dropped the second one as well.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Now both were gone.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Often, the best thing to do with a lost cause is to let it go.
      Because pursuing it gets in the way of the causes you haven’t lost yet.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>April 9, 2019</p>
    <p>“What with history being rewritten so often, nobody knows what is true
      anymore. They lose track of who is an enemy and who an ally. It’s that
      kind of story.”</p>
    <p>““They rewrite history.”</p>
    <p>““Robbing people of their actual history is the same as robbing them of
      part of themselves. It’s a crime.”</p>
    <p>“Fuka-Eri thought about that for a moment.</p>
    <p>“Tengo went on, “Our memory is made up of our individual memories and
      our collective memories. The two are intimately linked. And history is
      our collective memory. If our collective memory is taken from us—is
      rewritten—we lose the ability to sustain our true selves.”” &mdash;
      Haruki Murakami <em>1Q84</em></p>

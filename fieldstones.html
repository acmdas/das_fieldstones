<p>
If you have ill will toward any, if you are prejudiced against any, if you have accused any even in your silent thought, of injustice, or if you have criticised any one, sit down alone at night before retiring and mentally ask him to forgive you. Calling him by name, silently confess to him what you have done, and ask his forgiveness, telling him as you do the others, over and over again, that you love him, and are sure there is nothing but God”™s perfect Love between you. Never retire until you have thus definitely “cleaned up the slate” between yourself and every other human being, having definitely forgiven—given love for—every one. Keep at this until all the tightened cords which have been cutting off the free flow of God”™s love and life through you are loosened; until a habit of forgiving is established within you. — H.

<p>Thu, 07 Jul 2011 17:15:55</p>
<p>
I recently sent the following to a behavioral health researcher who was planning to develop a mobile application for clinicians that would include client information–I believe that it may be of interest to others who are considering the use of smart phones and laptops in their clinical practice: “As you know, any high-technology product aimed at the medical market (defined in the sense of being subject to the Federal privacy regulations HIPAA and Hitech) needs to not only take all appropriate steps to protect the clients’ identity and other protected health information (PHI), but it must do so demonstrably. By that, I mean that it must protect the information and also appear to protect it to the satisfaction of funders, consumers and regulators.<!--more-->”When we are serving the portion of the medical market which includes consumers of substance-abuse treatment (broadly defined) we must also satisfy the Federal privacy regulations found in 42 C.F.R. Part 2. These regulations represent a thornier matter for the provider of technology services not only because they are much stricter than HIPAA and Hitech, but they were written long before digital exchange of PHI was common, and thus were not written with an eye to ease of compliance (as were HIPAA and Hitech). “In our particular application, then, we must look at two concerns: - Will we be putting PHI at an unusual risk; and - Will we be able to readily convince the reviewers at SAMHSA that our product is adequately secure.”We all have heard about high-profile security breaches caused by sensitive data being stored on a portable device (typically a laptop) which is then either left in a public place or is stolen from a car or home. Credit card companies, hospitals and nuclear weapons laboratories have all found themselves on the front pages in recent years in this way, and they are never able to explain the breach away — because it is indefensible that the data in question were ever stored on a portable device in the first place. “Portable devices are by their nature insecure. When we designed [a recent online assessment system], like any system designed to protect sensitive data, we designed”rings" of protection. The data were encrypted. Access to the servers both from the Internet and from within the data center was carefully restricted. And finally, physical access to the server devices was controlled in the most rigorous manner. This is, obviously, not possible with a laptop in the back seat of a car, in a hotel room or a living room table. This is even less possible with a cell phone, which will tend to be on its user’s person most of their waking hours and can be dropped or stolen as easily as a wallet or a pair of glasses. “So, from my personal professional perspective, without a compelling reason to use the cell phone as the platform for this application, physical security concerns strongly suggest a more secure platform. Added to this is the relative newness of the Android or iOS (iPhone) software environments. With years of experience (years from now), we will have a good idea how to measure and mitigate risk on those platforms, as we have learned to measure and mitigate risk on the more mature hardware/software environments. While Android is based on a Linux kernel, which has a good history, its application on the cell phone hardware, using the cell network, is largely unproven ground. This also tends to concern me. I’m excited about Android and have plans to develop for it, but nothing that needs to be secure.”The IT engineers at SAMHSA will be asking themselves similar questions, and will very possibly come to a similar conclusion. We will have to write a Security Plan and submit it to them, and it will not have the same components that they are expecting. Were we to put my concerns to rest, we would then have to do the same in the Security Plan, and I would expect that would be difficult to write, and would be given extremely close scrutiny. “Taken as a whole, my considered judgment is that the prudent course of action would be to redesign the application to use a more conventional architecture — a server behind a firewall in a secure data center — one that we can be more confident of securing and more confident of getting approved.”

There’s nothing new, nothing arcane there, but they are the cold, hard facts that we all have to remember if we make any pretense of caring about our clients’ privacy. Simple things, like “If a bad guy can persuade you to run his program on your computer, it’s not your computer anymore.” Do you have client phone numbers on your iPhone? Have you installed any apps?

<p>Tue, 17 Mar 2015 11:31:38</p>
<p>
Emmet Fox challenges “believers” to accept that miracles are a necessary part of the gospel story, and likewise challenges “skeptics” to consider that they are a natural part of a universe that science doesn’t fully comprehend.
<h1 align="center">
Miracles
</h1>
Now, one must extend every sympathy to the special pleadings of a man enthralled by the beauty and mystery of the Gospels, but who, in the absence of the Spiritual Key, seems to find his common sense and all the scientific knowledge of mankind flouted by much that these Gospels contain. But this simply will not do. If the miracles did not happen, the rest of the Gospel story loses all real significance.<!--more--> If Jesus did not believe them to be possible, and undertake to perform them””never, it is true, for the sake of display, but still constantly and repeatedly””if he did not believe and teach many things in flat contradiction to eighteenth-and nineteenth-century rationalistic philosophy, then the Gospel message is chaotic, contradictory, and devoid of all significance. We cannot ride away from the dilemma by saying that Jesus was not interested in the current beliefs and superstitions of his time; that he took them more or less for granted passively; because what really interested him was character. This is a feeble argument, because character must include both an intelligent and a vital all-round reaction to life. Character must include some definite beliefs and convictions concerning things that really matter. But the miracles did happen. All the deeds related of Jesus in the four Gospels did happen, and many others too, “the which, if they should be written, every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written.” Jesus himself justified what people thought to be a strange and wonderful teaching by the works he was able to do; and he went further and said, referring to those who study and practice his teaching: “The works that I do, ye shall do, and greater works.” Now what, after all, is a miracle? Those who deny the possibility of miracles on the ground that the universe is a perfect system of law and order, to the operation of which there can be no exceptions, are perfectly right. But the explanation is that the world of which we are normally aware, and with whose laws alone most people are acquainted, is only a fragment of the whole universe as it really is; and that there is such a thing as appealing from a lower to a higher law””from a lesser to a greater expression. Now the appeal from the lower to the higher law is not really a breach of law, for the possibility of such an appeal is part of the major constitution of the universe, and, therefore, in the sense of a real breach of law, miracles are impossible. Yet, in the sense that all the ordinary rules and limitations of the physical plane can be set aside or overridden by an understanding which has risen above them, miracles, in the colloquial sense of the word, can and do happen.

When I heard that Pope Francis had visited the Little Sisters of the Poor last night, I heard Martin Luther King’s voice saying his words from Birmingham Jail: “One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.” He deserves his propers for doing that.

<p>Sun, 11 Sep 2016 00:58:53</p>
<p>
It’s a stretch to remember what concerned me fifteen years ago, on September 10. 2001. William Butler Yeats wrote <em>Easter, 1916</em> in part describing Easter Sunday, April 23, 1916, the day before the Easter Rising, and how after Easter Monday:   He, too, has resigned his part   In the casual comedy;   He, too, has been changed in his turn,   Transformed utterly:   A terrible beauty is born. And W. H. Auden, in <em>September 1, 1939</em> covered the same ground as Germany poised to invade Poland:   Uncertain and afraid   As the clever hopes expire   Of a low dishonest decade:   Waves of anger and fear   Circulate over the bright   And darkened lands of the earth,   Obsessing our private lives;   The unmentionable odour of death. I can’t help noticing a significant difference that we face today, however. The Irish Republic was established three years after the Rising, and WWII had come to an end in just under six years after the invasion of Poland, long, terrible years that they were in both cases, but the still the denouement was achieved. And here we are, fifteen years later. I had no idea. Did you? Have you found the poem describing September 10, 2001? Is it too soon? h/t to Gerard Van der Leun

<h1 id="why-add-to-a-blog-in-2016">Why Add to a Blog in 2016?</h1>
<p>Thu, 22 Sep 2016 20:46:41</p>
<p>
Why, indeed? When Facebook, Twitter and whatever other social media silos exist out there, where Everybody is following Everybody else, why write something new to add to something as old-school, so Last Year or Last Decade as a blog, where arguably nobody will see it? Well, trust me, I’ve tried to share “socially”, at least on FB. I resisted joining that Place where Youngsters Talk Past Each Other for a while. My tipping point came sometime in the spring of 2012 while I was visiting Maryland to stay with my ailing Father. My first night there, my baby sister (who lived next door to him) dropped in and said, “Congratulations!” I was grateful for the kind words, but didn’t know why I was to be congratulated. “Because Caitlyn is having another baby — you’re going to be a Great-Grandpa again!” It turns out that any family news is now shared on Facebook and nowhere else. OK, I may be a Canuck by choice, but I’m not going to be Canute, ordering the tides to cease. I joined Facebook and tried to play the game. <!--more--> I’ve been as loyal a FB’er as an over-the-hill not-very-leftist Old Fart could, sharing family pictures, commenting kindly (most of the time) on others’ family pictures, and sharing silly pictures with humorous (if sometimes a bit sharp) “memes” and links to interesting articles about this and that. For the most part, I’ve practiced “Stifle yerself, Edith!” as I learned to do during my career as a Federal Consultant, surrounded by Feds, Social Workers and Academics who either tolerated my trogdolitism or blithely assumed that I was One Of Them politically or ideologically. This Federal Election Cycle, I’ve practiced and encouraged others to practice (with little effect) a strict policy of No Digs At Candidates — If You Must Talk Politics, Discuss What You’re For, Not Who You’re Repelled By. It’s been a struggle, but rewarding. I haven’t “unliked” anyone, although I’ve had to “unfollow” a few to not be constantly upset. Anyway, there are topics of interest to Old Farts other than Federal Politics, although this close to the Imperial Capital that seems hard to imagine. Every now and then I’d wax so fulsomely on some topic that the dreaded “see more” would appear with most of the thought swallowed by the FB interface (don’t get me started on the FB interface, though). All evidence is that none of those hidden words were ever seen or heard from again. I’ve been tempted to close a longer, thoughtful post with something bizarre, like a “farewell, cruel world” note just to see whether anyone at all read it, but instead I’ve decided to just hide it over here, in Consultingsmiths limbo. Cheers!

David Warren’s <a href="http://www.davidwarrenonline.com/" target="_blank">“Essays in Idleness”</a> blog is usually at least amusing or interesting, and not uncommonly thought provoking. I don’t know him personally, but I have the feeling that he’d be somewhat uncomfortable being described as “profound”, so I won’t do so. Today, he’s at least worth quoting: “A lot of time has been wasted by busybodied fools arguing that someone other than Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare; that someone other than Homer wrote Homer. (“Another poet of that generation who happened to have the same name.”) The time would be better spent reading such authors. The same is true, generally, of the Church Fathers: better to read them in their breadth, and not with a view to pursuing small vexatious points ”” inevitably to factional ends."

Well, now I know that at least one person other than Me, Myself and I drop in here…I was asked to moderate the first spam comment in literally years this morning. Something about “arena oxides” and how much the princess, their friend, was edified by the deep thinking and perceptive helping nature that I displayed in a post a few days ago, accompanied by a gibberish email address and several links that even I am too timid to follow. I guess I should thank Google for the exposure.

There was a time, years ago, when there were fairly frequent, short posts here, mostly of the TOTD (Thought of the Day) variety — pithy sayings, sentences or paragraphs gleaned from the day’s Internet prowling or the evening’s reading. Then the day came when I realized that, for the most part, those pithy sayings tended to be, well, possibly impolitic given the nature of my business arrangements (my primary client being the Federal Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, or CSAT, in essence not only Federal bureaucrats but almost entirely social workers). So, like a prudent if not courageous undercover something-or-other not at all progressive or even liberal (unless maybe Classical Liberal), I censored myself. Or, as Archie Bunker would say, “Stifle yerself!” So, enough deep background. I see that I told this story in more detail just a few months ago <a href="http://www.consultingsmiths.com/why-add-to-a-blog-in-2016/# more-428" target="_blank">here</a> so have a look if you’re interested. Today’s point, and I do have one, is that FaceBook and I are having a partial parting of the ways. And this is to tell why.<!--more--> First, the parting is partial because FB is still the only place to keep up with Grandkids and Great-Grandkids, particularly the ones in British Columbia. And other folks I give a damn about. So, I’ll be checking in off and on, liking and saying nice things about other folks posts now and then. Just trying to not see too much and saying as little as I can. It’s just too depressing — the alternative reality that a lot of my friends and family are living in isn’t somewhere I want to visit. So, to wrap this one up, I just might be putting stuff of interest, and even the occasional output from my fevered brain, here. We’ll see.

I had a Twitter account very early on. It’s deleted now, and all the related emails that I’ve gotten from Twitter, so I’m not sure exactly when, but sometime in 2008. I “tweeted” maybe twice or three times before this summer, then I discovered <a href="http://thestrobist.com" target="_blank">The Strobist</a> site and got excited about moving beyond “available light” photography. The Strobist has an amazing amount of information, including detailed tutorials, on using off-camera flash. Great resource, strongly recommended, but this is about Twitter. Sort of.<!--more--> David Hobby, aka “The Strobist”, decided some time ago to disable comments and move all communications with his viewers to Twitter, so I got on board to thank him for his generosity, and to ask a few questions. He responded generously and quickly every time, and all was right with the world. Since I’m not an habitual Tweeter (twitterer?) that was it until last week, when I got Yet Another weekly email from Twitter telling me how much I was missing by not logging in and tweeting. It was a slow day (they almost all are now) and David and Joe McNally and some other folks whose names I didn’t recognize were bemoaning the demise of everything good an bright in the world as we know it, or as we knew it, or something like that. And scrolling back, it had been like that pretty much since the election (yes, That election). Like on Facebook. Except I don’t get any pictures of my Great Grandsons on Twitter. So I shit-canned it. Nuked from orbit. Over after all these years.<!--more--> And, I do get that lots of folks really do believe the kinds of things that they’re saying, that it’s the attack of the Nazi Zombies from Mars or something and the end of all the goodness and sweetness from life. I get that, although I can’t comprehend how they get there, or seriously believe that it’s at all rational or sane. What I don’t get is people conflating the kind of talk that goes with this, implicitly or explicitly calling people who voted “the wrong way” Nazis or the like, with their business identity. How anyone who is the public face for their business or product, like David or Joe, who want people to pay to attend their photography training events, or actors or singers who want the public to attend their concerts or plays or movies, can feel at ease alienating half the American public? I’m not inclined to take part in boycotts at the drop of the hat — I am inclined to do things like eat more often at Chick-fil-a or buy from L. L. Bean if they are being shamed and boycotted for expressing an entirely normal opinion or supporting one or the other side in an election. I’m just like that. I’ll go back to The Strobist site and give him my pageviews, and buy from him anyway, but I don’t feel the same about doing it that I did before. I very well might buy a ticket to a movie that Meryl Streep is in (although I just might stay away from a movie that Ashley Judd is in after seeing her performance at the Womens’ March today) if it’s Really Special, but it’s going to have to be a Really Special one. I may be the only person who feels this way, and if so, it won’t mean anything to anybody’s business. I couldn’t afford to attend David or Joe’s seminar in Dubai anyway, and I don’t go to very many movies at all, and I’m not part of Beyonce’s crew, or whatever, so they won’t feel the loss. But it seems like they really don’t care, and that’s what I don’t get.

Spent a minute looking through FaceBook, making sure that everyone I know who chose to exercise their freedom of assembly in the city today made it out okay, and posting a picture I took of my granddaughter Sophia playing her violin. It occurred to me how nice it is that so many people feel free to say really disrespectful, vulgar things about the President of the United States in a public setting without fear of being called “Racist” and possibly losing their jobs. Just a thought.

One character I think of — having known a long time — provides an especially poignant example. Long ago I suspected there was something wrong with him. He was “on my side,” but I could never trust him. And this because, he always thought ahead. “He has more brains than he can handle,” I once said of him. A very full head and a rather empty chest. He had no spiritual anchor, no faith beneath his clouds. His principles were mere thoughts: fluff passing over. Even his religious views were “solidly pragmatic,” i.e. easily revised. He could not understand even his own body, because he was all brain. His views were in a constant state of “evolution”: becoming ever more titched. The head comes loose, when the heart is not screwed in. Again from David Warren’s <a href="http://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2017/02/13/brain-disease/" target="_blank">Essays in Idleness</a>.

Apropos all the recent fuss: 8 U.S.C.

I’ve been gradually working my way through all of the Heinlein corpus, and a year or so back I ran across his list of “things every adult should know” and one that I wasn’t close on was a foreign language. I’m confident that my two years of High School Spanish wouldn’t cut the mustard. So, I chose Latin. It’s been slow slogging, mainly due to distractions and inertia, but I’m making a little progress, so I thought that I should have been able to make more sense of “illegitimi non carborundum” than I did. “Illegitimi” and “non” were easy, but “carborundum” while familiar as a brand name didn’t appear in any form in any of the Latin dictionaries or word lists that I could find.<!--more--> Google saved the day — it’s a joke, and one apropos today for any of us old-fashioned folk. “Don’t let the bastards grind you down.”

“Certain magazines have symposiums (I will call them”˜symposia”™ if I am allowed to call the two separate South Kensington collections ”˜musea”™)" – G. K. Chesterton Amusing because it pokes at one of my own peccadilloes. Saying “peccadilloes” rather than “bad habits” deserves another clever poke at the same personal weakness, but it’s too early and I’ve had too little coffee.

“WHEREVER I go, my first object, if I wish to find out the truth, is to get hold of the Free Press in France as in England, and even in America. But I know that wherever I get hold of such an organ it will be very strongly coloured with the opinion, or even fanaticism, of some minority. The Free Press, as a whole, if you add it all up and cancel out one exaggerated statement against another, does give you a true view of the state of society in which you live. The Official Press to-day gives you an absurdly false one everywhere. What a caricature””and what a base, empty caricature””of England or France or Italy you get in the “Times,” or the “Manchester Guardian,” the “Matin,” or the “Tribune”! No one of them is in any sense general””or really national." ~Hilaire Belloc: The Free Press, XI, B.

Just stopped into FB to post a silly picture. Couldn’t help seeing the “Christians help the poor” and “If you don’t love Obamacare you’re a monster” pictures. Almost posted something like “Somehow I can’t make the leap from ‘Christians should care for the sick and hungry’ to ’Christians should make it illegal for other people to not give the Government their money to care for the sick and hungry” but I resisted the temptation (and avoided the firestorm). Am I a bad person?

“ALL you that feel youth slipping past you and that are desolate at the approach of age, be merry; it is not what it looks like from in front and from outside. There is a glory in all completion, and all good endings are but shining transitions. There will come a sharp moment of revelation when you shall bless the effect of time”¦ All you that have loved passionately and have torn your hearts asunder in disillusions, do not imagine that things broken cannot be mended by the good angels.” ~Hilaire Belloc: The Path to Rome.

Censorship &amp;# 8211; Come meet the new boss… <link>http://www.consultingsmiths.com/censorship-come-meet-the-new-boss/</link> Tue, 09 May 2017 14:36:15 http://www.consultingsmiths.com/?p=612

…the same as the old boss. * “AT present, it is not we that silence the Press; it is the Press that silences us. It is not a case of the Commonwealth settling how much the editors shall say; it is a case of the editors settling how much the Commonwealth shall know.” (Illustrated London News, Oct. 19, 1907) * “BUT the modern editor regards himself far too much as a kind of original artist, who can select and suppress facts with the arbitrary ease of a poet or a caricaturist.” (ILN, Oct. 26, 1907) * “THE frivolous chatter is now all in public journalism.” (ILN, Feb. 1908) * “THERE is no fear that a modern king will attempt to override the constitution: it is more likely that he will ignore the constitution and work behind its back. He will take no advantage of his kingly power: it is more likely that he will take advantage of his kingly powerlessness – of the fact that he is free from criticism and publicity. For the King is the most private person of our time. It will not be necessary for anyone to fight against the proposal of a censorship of the Press. We do not need a censorship of the Press. We have a censorship by the Press.” (Orthodoxy, 1908) * “THE new method of journalism is to offer so many comments or, at least, secondary circumstances that there is actually no room left for the original facts.” (ILN, Nov. 6, 1909) * “IT is by this time practically quite impossible to get the truth out of newspapers, even the honest newspapers.” (ILN, Jan. 23, 1909) * “AND the papers are shouting louder and louder like demagogues, merely because their hearers are growing more and more deaf.” (ILN, Dec. 8, 1928) * “WHAT I protest against is the prevailing fashion, in the Press and elsewhere, of parading all this perfectly natural indifference and ignorance as if it were a sort of impartiality.” (ILN, Apr. 12, 1930) ~G.K. Chesterton

<p>
“The very word”secrecy" is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it." — John F. Kennedy

“Directly above my head on the glass-topped coffee table are Doris’s favorite books just as she left them… <i>Siddhartha Atlas Shrugged ESP and the New Spirituality</i>”Books matter. My poor wife, Doris, was ruined by books…, not by dirty books, but by clean books, not by depraved books but by spiritual books. God, if you recall, did not warn his people against dirty books. He warned them against high places. My wife, who began life as a cheerful Episcopalian from Virginia, became a priestess of the high places…But books ruined her. Beware of Episcopal women who take up with Ayn Rand and the Buddha…A certain type of Episcopal girl has a weakness that comes on them just past youth, just as sure as Italian girls get fat. They fall prey to Gnostic pride, commence buying antiques, and develop a yearning for esoteric doctrine." — Walker Percy: <i>Love in the Ruins</i>

Men Have Forgotten God <link>http://www.consultingsmiths.com/men-have-forgotten-god/</link> Wed, 17 May 2017 15:21:25 http://www.consultingsmiths.com/?p=629
<p>
More than half a century ago, while I was still a child, I recall hearing a number of older people offer the following explanation for the great disasters that had befallen Russia: Men have forgotten God; that’s why all this has happened. Since then I have spent well-nigh fifty years working on the history of our Revolution; in the process I have read hundreds of books, collected hundreds of personal testimonies, and have already contributed eight volumes of my own toward the effort of clearing away the rubble left by that upheaval. But if I were asked today to formulate as concisely as possible the main cause of the ruinous Revolution that swallowed up some sixty million of our people, I could not put it more accurately than to repeat: Men have forgotten God; that’s why all this has happened. What is more, the events of the Russian Revolution can only be understood now, at the end of the century, against the background of what has since occurred in the rest of the world. What emerges here is a process of universal significance. And if I were called upon to identify briefly the principal trait of the entire twentieth century, here too, I would be unable to find anything more precise and pithy than to repeat once again: Men have forgotten God. — <a href="http://www.roca.org/OA/36/36h.htm" target="_blank">Alexander Solzhenitsyn</a>

“Do you wonder why the legacy media are such puzzled otherworldly twits? Why, for example, they had no idea what was happening in the recent election? Why they seem to know so very little about America or much of anything else?”Some thoughts from a guy who spent a career in the racket:<br />
“Ask journalists when they were last in a truck stop on an Interstate, last in Boone, North Carolina or Barstow, California or any of thousands of such towns across the country. Ask whether they were in the military, whether they have ever talked to a cop or an ambulance crewman or a fireman. Ask whether they have a Mexican friend, when they last ate in a restaurant where a majority of the customers were black. Whether they know an enlisted man, or anyone in the armed services. Whether they have hitchhiked overnight, baited a hook, hunted, or fired a rifle. Whether they have ever worked washing dishes, harvesting crops, driving a delivery truck. Whether they have a blue-collar friend. Know what the Texas Two-Step is, have been in a biker bar.”Now do you see why Trump surprised them?" — <a href="https://fredoneverything.org/notes-of-a-reformed-news-weasel-understanding-the-vacuity/" target="_blank">Fred Reed</a>

“Journalists are not stupid, running to well above average in intelligence. You could form a large chapter of Mensa by raiding newsrooms in Washington. However, with a fair few exceptions, they are not intellectuals, not contemplative, not studious. They are high-pressure fact-accountants, competitive, comfortable under tight deadlines, aggressive, combative, quick but shallow.

A Great Man <link>http://www.consultingsmiths.com/a-great-man/</link> Thu, 08 Jun 2017 16:11:48 http://www.consultingsmiths.com/?p=663

“Whatever the word ‘great’ means, Dickens was what it means. Even the fastidious and unhappy who cannot read his books without a continuous critical exasperation, would use the word of him without stopping to think.” — G. K. Chesterton, <em>Charles Dickens</em>

“It would be futile to make a sketch of St. Thomas and conceal the fact that he fought with heretics; and yet the fact itself may embarrass the very purpose for which it is employed. I can only express the hope, and indeed the confidence, that those who regard me as the heretic will hardly blame me for expressing my own convictions, and certainly not for expressing my hero’s convictions. There is only one point upon which such a question concerns this very simple narrative. It is the conviction, which I have expressed once or twice in the course of it, that the sixteenth-century schism was really a belated revolt of the thirteenth-century pessimists. It was a back-wash of the old Augustinian Puritanism against the Aristotelian liberality. Without that, I could not place my historical figure in history.” — G. K. Chesterton <em>Saint Thomas Aquinas — the Dumb Ox</em>

In Your Philosophy, Horatio <link>http://www.consultingsmiths.com/in-your-philosophy-horatio/</link> Sun, 11 Jun 2017 13:57:46 http://www.consultingsmiths.com/?p=668

“There can be no doubt that there is an essential relation between Christian revelation and certain fundamental natural truths. The existence of objective truth, the spiritual reality of the person, the difference between soul and body, the objectivity of moral good and evil, the freedom of the will, the immortality of the soul, the existence of a personal God — all are implied by Christian revelation. Every word in the New Testament clearly presupposes these elementary truths. And any philosophy that denies them can never be accepted or tolerated by the Church.” — Deitrich von Hildebrand, <em>Trojan Horse in the City of God</em> (p. 62)

“We say that it is in believing ages that you get men living in the open and dancing and telling tales by the fire. We say that it is in ages of unbelief, that you get emperors dressing up as women, and gladiators, or minor poets wearing green carnations and praising unnameable things. We say that, taking ages as a whole, the wildest fantasies of superstition are nothing to the fantasies of rationalism.” — G. K. Chesterton, <em>God and my Neighbour</em>

The Pagan Ideal <link>http://www.consultingsmiths.com/the-pagan-ideal/</link> Sun, 25 Jun 2017 21:50:15 http://www.consultingsmiths.com/?p=689
<p>
“My objection to Mr. Lowes Dickinson and the reassertors of the pagan ideal is, then, this. I accuse them of ignoring definite human discoveries in the moral world, discoveries as definite, though not as material, as the discovery of the circulation of the blood. We cannot go back to an ideal of reason and sanity. For mankind has discovered that reason does not lead to sanity. We cannot go back to an ideal of pride and enjoyment. For mankind has discovered that pride does not lead to enjoyment. I do not know by what extraordinary mental accident modern writers so constantly connect the idea of progress with the idea of independent thinking. Progress is obviously the antithesis of independent thinking. For under independent or individualistic thinking, every man starts at the beginning, and goes, in all probability, just as far as his father before him. But if there really be anything of the nature of progress, it must mean, above all things, the careful study and assumption of the whole of the past. I accuse Mr. Lowes Dickinson and his school of reaction in the only real sense. If he likes, let him ignore these great historic mysteries”” the mystery of charity, the mystery of chivalry, the mystery of faith. If he likes, let him ignore the plough or the printing-press. But if we do revive and pursue the pagan ideal of a simple and rational self-completion we shall end ”” where Paganism ended. I do not mean that we shall end in destruction. I mean that we shall end in Christianity." — G. K. Chesterton, <a href="https://www.ccel.org/ccel/chesterton/heretics.xii.html" target="_blank"><em>Heretics</em></a>

<p>
“Political ideals will vary according to men”™s views on human destiny. Those who are persuaded that the purpose of life is pleasure, or power, or honour, will reckon that State best arranged in which they can live comfortably, or acquire great wealth, or achieve great power and lord it over many. Others who think that the crowning good of virtue is the purpose of our present life will want an arrangement under which men can live virtuously and peaceably together. In short, political judgment will be settled by the sort of life a man expects and proposes to lead by living in a community.” — St. Thomas Aquinas: Commentary on Aristotle”™s ”˜Politics,”™ Book II, lect. 1.

“To say that the present is a time of change and upheaval, social, political and religious, is to state a truism so obvious as to invite ironic contradiction. The cataclysm through which we are passing is at once so vast in its dimensions and so profound in its penetration of individual life, that we may well shrink from looking to history for guidance on circumstances to which history itself affords no parallel. Yet it is no new thing for the established manners, customs and beliefs of men to be upset. In all such times of violent transition the same great problem of the reconciliation between old and new forces itself upon the judgement of mankind, and it should not be impossible to find in the lesser crises of the past principles of thought and action which may help us to deal with the gigantic perplexities of today.” — Oliver Chase Quick, <em>Essays in Orthodoxy</em> 1916

<p>
“The riddle of life is simply this. For some mad reason in this mad world of ours, the things which men differ about most are exactly the things about which they must be got to agree. Men can agree on the fact that the earth goes round the sun. But then it does not matter a dump whether the earth goes around the sun or the Pleiades. But men cannot agree about morals: sex, property, individual rights, fixity and contracts, patriotism, suicide, public habits of health — these are exactly the things that men tend to fight about. And these are exactly the things that must be settled somehow on strict principles. Study each of them, and you will find each of them works back certainly to a philosophy, probably to a religion.” — G. K. Chesterton, <em>The Victorian Age</em>

“What, then, shall a Catholic Christian do, if some small part of the Church cut itself off from the communion of the universal faith? What else but prefer the health of the whole body before the pestiferous and corrupt member? What if some new infection goeth about to corrupt, not in this case only a little part, but the whole Church? Then, likewise, shall he regard, and be sure to cleave unto Antiquity; which can now no more be seduced by any crafty novelty.” — Vincentius of Lerin. <em>The Doctrine of the Fathers</em>

The Gods of the Copybook Headings <link>http://www.consultingsmiths.com/the-gods-of-the-copybook-headings/</link> Mon, 24 Jul 2017 17:01:55 http://www.consultingsmiths.com/?p=724
<p>
The Gods of the Copybook Headings by Rudyard Kipling AS I PASS through my incarnations in every age and race, I make my proper prostrations to the Gods of the Market Place. Peering through reverent fingers I watch them flourish and fall, And the Gods of the Copybook Headings, I notice, outlast them all. We were living in trees when they met us. They showed us each in turn That Water would certainly wet us, as Fire would certainly burn: But we found them lacking in Uplift, Vision and Breadth of Mind, So we left them to teach the Gorillas while we followed the March of Mankind. <!--more--> We moved as the Spirit listed. They never altered their pace, Being neither cloud nor wind-borne like the Gods of the Market Place, But they always caught up with our progress, and presently word would come That a tribe had been wiped off its icefield, or the lights had gone out in Rome. With the Hopes that our World is built on they were utterly out of touch, They denied that the Moon was Stilton; they denied she was even Dutch; They denied that Wishes were Horses; they denied that a Pig had Wings; So we worshipped the Gods of the Market Who promised these beautiful things. When the Cambrian measures were forming, They promised perpetual peace. They swore, if we gave them our weapons, that the wars of the tribes would cease. But when we disarmed They sold us and delivered us bound to our foe, And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: “Stick to the Devil you know.” On the first Feminian Sandstones we were promised the Fuller Life (Which started by loving our neighbour and ended by loving his wife) Till our women had no more children and the men lost reason and faith, And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: “The Wages of Sin is Death.” In the Carboniferous Epoch we were promised abundance for all, By robbing selected Peter to pay for collective Paul; But, though we had plenty of money, there was nothing our money could buy, And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: “If you don’t work you die.” Then the Gods of the Market tumbled, and their smooth-tongued wizards withdrew And the hearts of the meanest were humbled and began to believe it was true That All is not Gold that Glitters, and Two and Two make Four And the Gods of the Copybook Headings limped up to explain it once more. As it will be in the future, it was at the birth of Man There are only four things certain since Social Progress began. That the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her Mire, And the burnt Fool’s bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire; And that after this is accomplished, and the brave new world begins When all men are paid for existing and no man must pay for his sins, As surely as Water will wet us, as surely as Fire will burn, The Gods of the Copybook Headings with terror and slaughter return!

Okay, time for a little “David admits his prejudices” post. Apparently you can get a journalism (or it is “Communications” now) degree without reading Strunk and White? And you can publish articles without any perusal by an editor who has read Strunk and White? That has to be the case when foolishness like “amount of people” rather than “number of people” or “most well-known” instead of “best known” appears over and over and over again. These are Heinlein’s Crazy Years, we just live in them!

Darling Valerie reminded me of another sin against the English language and all who speak it: misusing “gift” as a verb. “Gift” is not a verb, it is a noun. “Gifted” is an adjective, not the past tense of anything, and “gifting” is nothing other than, well, let’s leave it at “nothing”.

“PHILOSOPHY is merely thought that has been thought out. It is often a great bore. But man has no alternative, except between being influenced by thought that has been thought out and being influenced by thought that has not been thought out. The latter is what we commonly call culture and enlightenment today.” — G.K. Chesterton: <em>The Revival of Philosophy””Why?</em>

“It is as much a crime to disturb the peace when truth prevails as it is a crime to keep the peace when truth is violated. There is therefore a time in which peace is justified and a time when it is not justifiable. For it is written that there is a time for peace and a time for war and it is the law of truth that distinguishes the two. But at no time is there a time for truth and a time for error, for it is written that God’s truth shall abide forever. That is why Christ has said that He has come to bring peace and at the same time that He has come to bring the sword. But He does not say that He has come to bring both the truth and the falsehood.” — Blaise Pascal

<p>
“We live in times in which there is a widespread notion that to correct sinners is to “judge” them. Never mind that it is sin that we judge, not the sinner. Never mind that in accusing us of judging, the worldly-minded are themselves doing the very judging they condemn. Never mind any of that; the point of the charge is to try to shame us into silence. Despite the fact that Scripture consistently directs us to correct the sinner, many Catholics have bought into the notion that correcting the sinner is “judging” him. In this, the devil, who orchestrates the “correcting is judging” campaign, rejoices; for if he can keep us from correcting one another, sin can and does flourish." — <a href="http://blog.adw.org/2017/09/obligation-clear-compassionate-correction-sinner-homily-23rd-sunday-year/" target="_blank">Msgr.

“When everything that smacks of the transcendent is eliminated from the public life of a culture, something has to take its place. In our case it is largely commerce and the ideals and ideas that commerce fosters. Moreover, the liberty that accompanies such a commercial society is a liberty whose chief effect is the dissolving of traditional ties and the destruction of traditional communities, whether that takes place because of direct attacks on the family and chastity or indirectly because of an economic system that works as a solvent in hundreds of ways: driving mothers out of the home, exploiting sex to sell products, moving families about to seek employment, or emptying rural areas of farm families.” — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Christendom-Americanism-Beyond-Jagged-Postmodern-ebook/dp/B01EJ0OQ92/ref=la_B001K7S392_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1505417861&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Thomas Storck</a>

<p>
”˜Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others ; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness: only power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from all the oligarchies of the past, in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now do you begin to understand me?”™ — George Orwell — <em>1984</em> O’Brien to Winston

Schism and Heresy <link>http://www.consultingsmiths.com/schism-and-heresy/</link> Fri, 13 Oct 2017 11:34:29 http://www.consultingsmiths.com/?p=793
<p>
“Heresy and schism are distinguished in respect of those things to which each is opposed essentially and directly. For heresy is essentially opposed to faith, while schism is essentially opposed to the unity of ecclesiastical charity. Wherefore just as faith and charity are different virtues, although whoever lacks faith lacks charity, so too schism and heresy are different vices, although whoever is a heretic is also a schismatic, but not conversely. This is what Jerome says in his commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians [In Ep. ad Tit. iii, 10]:”I consider the difference between schism and heresy to be that heresy holds false doctrine while schism severs a man from the Church." Nevertheless, just as the loss of charity is the road to the loss of faith, according to 1 Timothy 1:6: “From which things,” i.e. charity and the like, “some going astray, are turned aside into vain babbling,” so too, schism is the road to heresy. Wherefore Jerome adds (In Ep. ad Tit. iii, 10) that “at the outset it is possible, in a certain respect, to find a difference between schism and heresy: yet there is no schism that does not devise some heresy for itself, that it may appear to have had a reason for separating from the Church.” — St. Thomas Aquinas: <a href="http://newadvent.org/summa/3039.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Summa Theologica</a>, II-II, q. 39, a. 1, ad 3

<p>
“Therefore, heresy is so called from the Greek word meaning”˜choice,”™ by which each chooses according to his own will what he pleases to teach or believe. But we are not permitted to believe whatever we choose, nor to choose whatever someone else has believed. We have the apostles of God as authorities, who did not themselves of their own will choose what they would believe, but faithfully transmitted to the nations the teaching received from Christ. So, even if an angel from heaven should preach otherwise, he shall be called anathema.” — St. Isidore of Seville (c. 560 — 636): Etymologies, 8, 3.

<p>
“IT is an interesting speculation by what means the Book lost its old position in this country. This is not only an interesting speculation, but one which nearly concerns a vital matter. For if men fall into the habit of neglecting true books in an old and traditional civilization, the inaccuracy of their judgments and the illusions to which they will be subject, must increase.”To take but one example: history. The less the true historical book is read and the more men depend upon ephemeral statement, the more will legend crystallize, the harder will it be to destroy in the general mind some comforting lie, and the great object-lesson of politics (which is an accurate knowledge of how men have acted in the past) will become at last unknown." — Hilaire Belloc: <a href="https://oldthunderbelloc.blogspot.com/2014/02/on-decline-of-book.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">On the Decline of the Book</a>

“It’s rampant.”The big reason is that we’re all impostors. You’re not imagining that you’re an impostor, it’s likely that you are one. “Everyone who is doing important work is working on something that might not work. And it’s extremely likely that they’re also not the very best qualified person on the planet to be doing that work.”How could it be any other way? The odds that a pure meritocracy chose you and you alone to inhabit your spot on the ladder is worthy of Dunning-Kruger status. You’ve been getting lucky breaks for a long time. We all have. “Yes, you’re an imposter. So am I and so is everyone else. Superman still lives on Krypton and the rest of us are just doing our best.”Isn’t doing your best all you can do? Dropping the narrative of the impostor isn’t arrogant, it’s merely a useful way to get your work done without giving into Resistance. “Time spent fretting about our status as impostors is time away from dancing with our fear, from leading and from doing work that matters.” — Seth Godin

“The Saint is a medicine because he is an antidote. Indeed that is why the saint is often a martyr; he is mistaken for a poison because he is an antidote. He will generally be found restoring the world to sanity by exaggerating whatever the world neglects, which is by no means always the same element in every age. Yet each generation seeks its saint by instinct; and he is not what the people want, but rather what the people need.” — G.K. Chesterton: <em>St. Thomas Aquinas</em>, Chap. I.

“Buddha is only for the West to study as history, that it is a subject for understanding, and Yoga can profitably be practiced to that end. But it is not for the West an Answer, not a Solution. We must learn by acting, experiencing, and living, that is, above all by Love and Suffering,” — Jack Kerouac — letter to William Burroughs, 1954

“In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don”™t see the use of this; let us clear it away." To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don”™t see the use of it, I certainly won”™t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it." — G. K. Chesterton, <em>The Drift from Domesticity</em>

The Task of Redemption <link>http://www.consultingsmiths.com/the-task-of-redemption/</link> Thu, 09 Nov 2017 22:20:49 http://www.consultingsmiths.com/?p=821
<p>
St. John Paul II describes how Christ’s act of redeeming us from slavery to sin is both a free gift and a task: “In the mystery of Redemption, Christ’s victory over evil is given to us not simply for our personal advantage, but also as a task. We accept that task as we set out upon the way of the interior life, working consciously on ourselves—with Christ as our Teacher. The Gospel calls us to follow this very path. Christ’s call”Follow me!" is echoed on many pages of the Gospel and is addressed to different people—not only to the Galilean fishermen whom Jesus calls to become his Apostles (cf. Mt 4:19, Jn 1:43), but also, for example, to the rich young man in the Synoptic Gospels (cf. Mt 19:16-22, Mk 10:17:22, Lk 18:18-23). Jesus’s conversation with him is one of the key texts to which we must constantly return, from various points of view, as I did, for example, in the encyclical Veritatis Splendor. <!--more--> “The call”Follow me!" is an invitation to set out along the path to which the inner dynamic of the mystery of Redemption leads us. This is the path indicated by the teaching, so often found in writings on the interior life and on mystical experience, about the three stages involved in “following Christ.” These three stages are sometimes called “ways.” We speak of the purgative way, the illuminative way, and the unitive way. In reality, these are not three distinct ways, but three aspects of the same way, along which Christ calls everyone, as he once called that young man in the Gospel. “When the young man asks:”Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?“, Christ answers him:”If you wish to enter life, keep the commandments" (Mt 19:16 et passim). And when the young man continues to ask: “Which?” Christ simply reminds him of the principal commandments of the Decalogue, and especially those from the so-called “second tablet” concerning relations with one’s neighbor. In Christ’s teaching, of course, all the commandments are summarized in the commandment to love God above all things and one’s neighbor as oneself. He says so explicitly to a doctor of the Law in response to a question (cf. Mt 22:34-40; Mk 12:28-31). Observance of the commandments, properly understood, is synonymous with the purgative way: it means conquering sin, moral evil in its various guises. And this leads to a gradual inner purification. “It also enables us to discover values. And hence we conclude that the purgative way leads organically into the illuminative way. Values are lights which illumine existence and, as we work on our lives, they shine ever more brightly on the horizon. So side by side with observance of the commandments—which has an essentially purgative meaning—we develop virtues. For example, in observing the commandment:”Thou shall not kill!" we discover the value of life under various aspects and we learn an ever deeper respect for it. In observing the commandment: “Thou shall not commit adultery!” we acquire the virtue of purity, and this means that we come to an ever greater awareness of the gratuitous beauty of the human body, of masculinity and femininity. This gratuitous beauty becomes a light for our actions. In observing the commandment: “Thou shall not bear false witness!” we learn the virtue of truthfulness. This not only excludes all lying and hypocrisy from our lives, but it develops within us a kind of “instinct for truth” which guides all our actions. And living thus in the truth, we acquire in our own humanity a connatural truthfulness. “So the illuminative stage in the interior life emerges gradually from the purgative stage. With the passage of time, if we persevere in following Christ our Teacher, we feel less and less burdened by the struggle against sin, and we enjoy more and more the divine light which pervades all creation. This is most important, because it allows us to escape from a situation of constant inner exposure to the risk of sin—even though, on this earth, the risk always remains present to some degree—so as to move with ever greater freedom within the whole of the created world. The same freedom and simplicity characterizes our relations with other human beings, including those of the opposite sex. Interior light illumines our actions and shows us all the good in the created world as coming from the hand of God. Thus the purgative way and then the illuminative way form the organic introduction to what is known as the unitive way. This is the final stage of the interior journey, when the soul experiences a special union with God. This union is realized in contemplation of the divine Being and in the experience of love which flows from it with growing intensity. In this way we somehow anticipate what is destined to be ours in eternity, beyond death and the grave. Christ, supreme Teacher of the spiritual life, together with all those who have been formed in his school, teaches that even in this life we can enter onto the path of union with God.” — St. John Paul II – <em>Memory and Identity</em> Rizzoli 2005:

“As the old saying goes, the flip side of love is hatred. You cannot care about something, and fail to hate what threatens it. This leads us to the difficult question of what to love, and the Left posits universal love, which for them means pretending to be a god and loving everything, without understanding that the love of a god is love for creation itself, not a desire to preserve each part.” — <a href="http://www.amerika.org/politics/love-possesses-two-dimensions/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Brett Stevens</a>

“The point about the Press is that it is not what it is called. It is not the”popular Press." It is not the public Press. It is not an organ of public opinion. It is a conspiracy of a very few millionaires, all sufficiently similar in type to agree on the limits of what this great nation (to which we belong) may know about itself and its friends and enemies. The ring is not quite complete; there are old-fashioned and honest papers: but it is sufficiently near to completion to produce on the ordinary purchaser of news the practical effects of a corner and a monopoly. He receives all his political information and all his political marching orders from what is by this time a sort of half-conscious secret society, with very few members, but a great deal of money." — G.K. Chesterton: <em>Utopia of Usurers and Other Essays</em>

“The fact of the matter is, one cannot be both a cultural relativist and a revolutionary. The revolutionary proposes changing the culture. A cultural relativist can never propose such a change. What standard could be used? A cultural relativist, were he honest, would hold his own culture to the same standards as a foreign culture, and say that our laws, traditions, and customs cannot be changed or criticized”” for if the only yardstick of what is considered right or wrong comes from the culture, well, obviously this applies to Christendom (aka Western Culture) as well." — <a href="http://www.scifiwright.com/2017/11/fooled-by-heinlein-for-fourty-years/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">John C.

“The eternal God is thy refuge.” He is a sanctuary, a refuge from the cares of life. You can get away from the misunderstanding of others by retiring into your own place of meditation. But from yourself, from your sense of failure, your weakness, your shortcomings, whether can you flee? Only to the eternal God, your refuge, until the immensity of His spirit envelopes your spirit and it loses its smallness and weakness and comes into harmony again with His. Prayer for the Day I pray that I may lose my limitations in the immensity of God’s love. I pray that my spirit may be in harmony with His spirit. From the original AA Meditation book, <em>Twenty-Four Hours a Day</em>, by Richmond Walker

“When a house has no master living in it, it becomes dark, vile and contemptible, choked with filth and disgusting refuse. So too is a soul which has lost its master, who once rejoiced there with his angels. This soul is darkened with sin, its desires are degraded, and it knows nothing but shame.”Woe to the path that is not walked on, or along which the voices of men are not heard, for then it becomes the haunt of wild animals. Woe to the soul if the Lord does not walk within it to banish with his voice the spiritual beasts of sin. Woe to the house where no master dwells, to the field where no farmer works, to the pilotless ship, storm-tossed and sinking. Woe to the soul without Christ as its true pilot; drifting in the darkness, buffeted by the waves of passion, storm-tossed at the mercy of evil spirits, its end is destruction. Woe to the soul that does not have Christ to cultivate it with care to produce the good fruit of the Holy Spirit. Left to itself, it is choked with thorns and thistles; instead of fruit it produces only what is fit for burning. Woe to the soul that does not have Christ dwelling in it; deserted and foul with the filth of the passions, it becomes a haven for all the vices." — <a href="http://blog.adw.org/2017/11/a-culture-without-god-is-adrift-like-a-ship-without-a-pilot/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">St. Macarius, bishop</a>, <em>Hom. 28: PG 34, 710-711</em>

“Where there is no giving of one self, one can only love the physical attributes of the other. Poets and philosophers have filled many volumes musing about the fleeting beauty of youth. Those who can only love that surface shine will soon grow bored. That boredom will be followed by some sort of hate or indifference. Those who love the soul are different because for them, their youth is a sacrificial present, an oblation offered in the altar of love. The men and women of God conquer each other not by possession but by surrendering and becoming part of the beloved.” — <a href="https://casorosendi.wordpress.com/2017/12/18/the-days-of-wormwood/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Carlos Caso_Rosendi</a>

“We may consider the material world as the clay which the artist works with, to make of it something beautiful or ugly. We need not fear material things, which are neither good nor bad in the moral sense. There seems to be no active force for evil—outside of human beings themselves. Humans alone can have either evil intentions—resentments, malevolence, hate and revenge—or good intentions—love and good will, They can make something ugly or something beautiful out of the clay of their lives.” — Twenty-Four Hours a Day entry for December 19

“I want everyone to stop using the word “gender” for anything other than masculine and feminine nouns. I am male. I am of the male sex. I am not of the male gender. You do not have choice in participating in your sexual identity, contrary to all fashionable nonsense of the era. “Gender” is akin to the Marxist use of the word “exploitation”. It is ideologically loaded; it is nonsense on stilts. Biology is not a social construct." — Written by one of those bloggers who, for whatever reason, won’t use a “real” name. Found <a href="http://www.barrelstrength.com/2017/12/20/deconstructing-jordan-peterson/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>. Oh, and by the way, I agree totally and unreservedly. I’m certainly open to the thought that we need to be willing for men and women to dress, walk and talk in ways other than how John Wayne or Rita Hayworth dressed, walked and talked, but let’s be serious. Once a man, always a man. And vice versa.

Hiding from the mission <link>http://www.consultingsmiths.com/hiding-from-the-mission/</link> Sun, 07 Jan 2018 20:13:07 http://www.consultingsmiths.com/?p=887
<p>
We do this in two ways: The first is refusing to be clear and precise about what the mission is. Avoiding specifics about what we hope to accomplish and for whom. Being vague about success and (thus about failure). After all, if no one knows exactly what the mission is, it’s hard feel like a failure if it doesn’t succeed. The second is even more insidious. We degrade the urgency of the mission. We become diffuse. We get distracted. Anything to avoid planting a stake and saying, “I made this.” It’s possible to spend 7 hours and 52 minutes out of an eight-hour day in doing nothing but hiding from the mission. And it’s exhausting. <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2018/01/hiding-from-the-mission.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Seth Godin</a>

“Because God is not a finite object over against you as a subject, you cannot simply turn away towards”˜something else.”™; He is the ground and end of all desire and knowledge as such, the Good in itself. You cannot choose or not choose God the way you would choose or not choose a cup of coffee. You desire anything because of your original desire for God as the transcendental Good and Beautiful; you know anything because of your original intellectual appetite for God as the transcendental Truth as such. Even in desiring to flee God, you are desiring God as the ”˜good end”™ you seek in godlessness. He is inescapable because all being, goodness, unity, truth, and beauty simply are God in their transcendent truth, and because a rational nature is nothing but an infinite dynamic orientation towards that transcendent end. The natural will, as Maximus says, can will only God. Don”™t think of God as a candidate in a political race, whom you could simply reject and be done with; he is the original and final act of your every discrete act of desire. And, in the ages, since God is all and there is literally nothing beyond him, the natural will is always seeking its natural supernatural end. Simply said, God is not an object of desire; he is the end that makes desire.” — <a href="https://afkimel.wordpress.com/essential-readings-on-universalism/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">David Bentley Hart</a>

Being Christian <link>http://www.consultingsmiths.com/being-christian/</link> Wed, 10 Jan 2018 23:38:35 http://www.consultingsmiths.com/?p=891
<p>
“It is almost universally assumed today that becoming a Christian means in essence the adoption of a new set of beliefs or the initiation of a new mode of behaviour. A Christian would be defined as one who ‘believes in Christ’ or ‘worships Christ’ or ‘tries to follow Christ’s teaching.’ Now it is far from my purpose to belittle either Christian dogma or Christian ethics. Nevertheless, it must be pointed out that to define the essence of Christianity in terms of belief or of practice involves the neglect of two principles that are fundamental to all sound theology. The former of these is that the act of God precedes and is presupposed by the acts of man: ‘Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us’; ‘Ye have come to know God, <em>or rather to be known of God</em>.’ The second is that what a being <em>is</em> precedes what it <em>does</em>; our actions are a consequence of what we are <em>operari sequitur esse</em>. It will follow from this that the Christian should be defined not in terms of what he himself does, but of what God has made him to be. Being a Christian is an ontological fact, resulting from an act of God.” — E. L. Mascall, <em>Christ, the Christian, and the Church</em> p.77

I will relax and not get tense. I will have no fear, because everything will work out in the end. I will learn soul-balance and poise in a vacillating, changing world. I will claim God’s power and use it because if I do not use it, it will be withdrawn. As long as I get back to God and replenish my strength after each task, no work can be too much. Prayer for the Day I pray that I may relax and that God’s strength will be given to me. I pray that I may subject my will to God’s will and be free from all tenseness. From the original AA Meditation book, <em>Twenty-Four Hours a Day</em>, by Richmond Walker

<p>
“What did Jesus want to say to us? What does he want from us today? How does he help us to be faithful Christians today? It is not ultimately important to us what this or that church leader wants. Rather, we want to know what Jesus wants. When we go to hear a sermon, his own word is what we want to hear. This matters to us not only for our own sakes, but also for all those who have become estranged from the church and its message. It is also our opinion that if Jesus himself and Jesus alone with his word were among us in our preaching, then quite a different set of people would hear the word and quite a different set of people would again turn away from it.” — Dietrich Bonhoeffer, <em>The Cost of Discipleship</em>

“A man, walking through the forest saw a fox that had lost its legs, and wondered how it lived. Then he saw a tiger come up with game in its mouth. The tiger ate its fill and left the rest of the meat for the fox. The next day God fed the fox by means of the same tiger.”The man began to wonder at God”™s greatness and said to himself, ‘I too shall just rest in a corner with full trust in the Lord and He will provide me with all I need.’ “He did this for many days, but nothing happened, and he was almost at death”™s door when he heard a voice say, ‘O you who are in the path of error, open your eyes to the truth! Stop imitating the disabled fox and follow the example of the tiger’” — Ernie Kurtz

Turning and turning in the widening gyre<br />
The falcon cannot hear the falconer; Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere The ceremony of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction, while the worst Are full of passionate intensity. Surely some revelation is at hand; Surely the Second Coming is at hand. The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out<br />
When a vast image out of <em>Spiritus Mundi</em> Troubles my sight: a waste of desert sand;<br />
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,<br />
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,<br />
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it<br />
Wind shadows of the indignant desert birds.<br />
The darkness drops again; but now I know<br />
That twenty centuries of stony sleep Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,<br />
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,<br />
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born? — William Butler Yeats, 1919

Steven Pressfield <a href="http://www.stevenpressfield.com/2018/02/untitled-book-installment-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted this</a> today:
<blockquote>
I have a theory about the Hero”™s Journey. We all have one. We have many, in fact. But our primary hero”™s journey as artists is the passage we live out, in real life, before we find our calling. The hero”™s journey is the search for that calling. It”™s preparation. It”™s initiation (or more precisely, self-initiation). On the hero”™s journey, we see, we experience, we suffer. We learn. On our hero”™s journey, we acquire a history that is ours alone. It”™s a secret history, a private history, a personal history. No one has it but us. No one knows it but us. This secret history is the most valuable possession we hold, or ever will hold. We will draw upon it for the rest of our lives. The hero”™s journey ends when, like Odysseus, we return home to Ithaca, to the place from which we started. We wash up on shore. We have survived. We have come home. Now what?
</blockquote>
Well, what? There’s a calling, that calling, the one that’s mysteriously been whispering and talking and yelling and screaming obscenities at you/me all along. Only now, it’s explicit. It’s there, not “out there” but “right there” and there’s some question but not much and not enough to put it off anymore. Now what? It’s been a long, strange trip, and it isn’t over. Hell, it’s not much more than just started. Now what?

Projection/Empathy <link>http://www.consultingsmiths.com/projection-empathy/</link> Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:06:03 http://www.consultingsmiths.com/?p=956
<p>
<blockquote>
The monologue that runs in our brain is loud. It’s heavy-metal loud compared to the quiet signals we get from the rest of the world. All day, every day, that noise keeps going. It’s the only voice that has seen everything we’ve seen, believes everything we believe. It’s the noise that not only criticizes every action of every other person who disagrees with us, but it criticizes their motives as well. And, if we question it, it criticizes us as well. Is it any wonder that projection is more powerful than empathy? When we meet people, we either celebrate when they agree with us or plot to change or ignore them when they don’t. There’s not a lot of room for, “they might have a different experience of this moment than I do.” That noise in our head is selfish, afraid and angry. That noise is self-satisfied, self-important and certain. That noise pushes intimacy away and will do anything it can to degrade those that might challenge us. But, against all odds, empathy is possible. It’s possible to amplify those too-quiet signals that others send us and to practice imagining, even for a moment, what it might be like to have their noise instead of our noise. If we put in the effort and devote the time to practice this skill, we can get better at it. We merely have to begin.

<blockquote>
You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift. You cannot help small men by tearing down big men. You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. You cannot lift the wage-earner by pulling down the wage-payer. You cannot help the poor man by destroying the rich. You cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than your income. You cannot further the brotherhood of man by inciting class hatred. You cannot establish security on borrowed money. You cannot build character and courage by taking away men’s initiative and independence. You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could and should do for themselves.

But I have lived, and have not lived in vain: My mind may lose its force, my blood its fire, And my frame perish even in conquering pain, But there is that within me which shall tire Torture and Time, and breathe when I expire: Something unearthly, which they deem not of, Like the remembered tone of a mute lyre, Shall on their softened spirits sink, and move In hearts all rocky now the late remorse of love.

“War, by imposing hardships and controls on daily life, produces an aggressive mentality and degrades people’s character according to their wretched conditions. The result in this case was a general state of public disorder in all countries. As time went on and the earlier atrocities became an accepted fact, the later ones were marked by refinements of technique and novel methods of retaliation. Even words lost their proper meanings and were changed to suit current propaganda . . . . family ties were broken for the sake of party loyalty. . . . Relations between people were governed not by the security of established customs but by the prospect of selfish gain in defiance of the law.” Does this sound familiar? Is this an apt description of our lifetime and that of our parents (or grandparents, that Greatest Generation)? These words were written by Thucydides to describe Athens as it warred with Sparta (ca. 400 B.C.).

<p>
Christianity has projected Jesus as the long-suffering, meek, and gentle “lamb of God.” The Gospels present another picture: Gentle and compassionate, yes, but the Jesus of these pages is predominantly strong, candid, and above all <em>authoritative</em>. As Harold points out:
<blockquote>
At the time, people did not marvel so much at what Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount as at the <em>authority</em> with which He spoke:
<blockquote>
“…the people were astonished at his doctrine; for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.”
</blockquote>
Today, “scribes” have rewritten these words. In <em>The New English Bible</em>, read the translation thirteen scholars offer to men whose souls are starved, and scared, and scarred—it is a timid bit:
<blockquote>
“. . . he taught with a note of authority.”
</blockquote>
The translators write in the tenor of their age—a “note” of faith in anything, a “note” of authority in anything, is all that is left. But because of this, the twentieth century is a time pregnant with the possibility of grasping truth, for now man must seek the authority within himself.
</blockquote>

<p>
Every human being, if he lives his normal span, suffers five traumatic events that serve to expand his consciousness and increase his need to know the truth of himself in being: the trauma of birth, of puberty, of recognizing himself to be cast out in solitary being, of losing his sexual competency, of anticipating the loss of his life. Thus, built into his nature are the stresses that periodically “flood the cellar” of his subconscious mind and free him of much of the “conditioned learning” society and Babel Tower builders have imposed upon him. Therefore, before death overtakes him, he is free of much of his spurious “conditioning.” — Preston Harold, <em>The Shining Stranger</em>, p. 95

Empathy, not Conscience <link>http://www.consultingsmiths.com/empathy-not-conscience/</link> Fri, 23 Mar 2018 20:04:09 http://www.consultingsmiths.com/?p=987
<p>
In man, empathy, not conscience, is the resonator. But conscience has a vital role to play. Just as a satellite must have a continuous sensing of its motion and attitude in space, keeping itself horizontal in relation to the surface of the earth below if it is to perform its complicated maneuvers, so man must have a continuous sense of “right or wrong,” regardless of the compassion his empathy arouses within him as he views good or evil in this world. Conscience, which is of the closed world of the past, acts as an “inertial reference package” to balance the course empathy takes. — Preston Harold, <em>The Shining Stranger</em>, p. 161

It occurred to me that I have “Spiritual ADD” — that I’ll get an inspiration that bounces all over, then gets lost.

Remember this…” From a note that I left to myself 6 April, 2017

“Saint Luke was a painter, by some accounts, and by others a physician. I think he was both, and more, from acquaintance with his writings. But certainly a physician. When Matthew and Mark recount the saying of Jesus, that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to pass through the gates of heaven, they use the Greek term for a household sewing needle. But Luke instinctively uses the term for a surgeon”™s suturing needle.

“When I first prepared this particular talk… I realized that my usual approach is usually critical. That is, a lot of the things that I do, that most people do, are because they hate something somebody else has done, or they hate that something hasn’t been done. And I realized that informed criticism has completely been done in by the web. Because the web has produced so much uninformed criticism. It’s kind of a Gresham’s Law – bad money drives the good money out of circulation. Bad criticism drives good criticism out of circulation. You just can’t criticize anything.” — Alan Kay <a href="https://vimeo.com/10260548" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>How Simply and Understandably Could The “Personal Computing Experience” Be Programmed?</em></a>

“We must remember that Galileo merely said that the language of nature is written in mathematics. He did not say everything is. And even the truth about nature need not be expressed in mathematics. For most of human history, the language of nature has been the language of myth and ritual. These forms, one might add, had the virtues of leaving nature unthreatened and of encouraging the belief that human beings are part of it. It hardly befits a people who stand ready to blow up the planet to praise themselves too vigorously for having found the true way to talk about nature.” &amp;mdash: Neil Postman <em>Amusing Ourselves to Death</em>

"”˜Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.”™ We”™ve all seen this quote of Lord Acton. Most people agree with it. I don”™t. Like many (if not most) great quotes, it is dead wrong. Why? Because it”™s exactly backwards, that”™s why… “Let”™s reconstruct Acton”™s sentence in a way that reflects the truth of the matter (and energy) of power. Put the word ”˜man”™ in place of ”˜power”™, and then move the word ”˜power”™ behind the word ”˜corrupt(s)”™. Now let”™s see what it should look like if we”™re truly seeking the truth: ”˜(Man) tends to corrupt power, and absolute (Man) corrupts power absolutely”™." — Ianto Watt <a href="http://wmbriggs.com/post/24549/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Lord Acton’s Apostasy</em></a>

“The problem is no longer getting people to express themselves, but providing little gaps of solitude and silence in which they might eventually find something to say. Repressive forces don”™t stop people from expressing themselves, but rather, force them to express themselves.

<p>
“Beckett wrote that Joyce believed fervently in the significance of chance events and of random connections.”˜To Joyce reality was a paradigm, an illustration of a possibly unstateable rule”¦ According to this rule, reality, no matter how much we try to manipulate it, can only shift about in continual movement, yet movement limited in its possibilities”¦”™ giving rise to ”˜the notion of the world where unexpected simultaneities are the rule.”™ In other words, a coincidence such as sitting down to dinner with James Joyce is actually just part of a continually moving pattern, like a kaleidoscope. Or Joyce likes to put it, a ”˜collideorscape”™." — Gabrielle Carey <em><a href="https://sydneyreviewofbooks.com/breaking-james-joyce/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Breaking Up With James Joyce</a></em> <a href="http://www.consultingsmiths.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MarxRealith.jpg"><img src="http://www.consultingsmiths.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MarxRealith-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1024" /></a>

<p>
“According to Ellman, Joyce”™s view of sin was influenced by Hermann Suderman”™s play Magda: ”˜Magda”™s philosophy of life may well have helped to shape Joyce”™s. As she says, “And one thing more, my friend — sin! We must sin if we wish to grow. To become greater than our sins is worth more than all the purity you preach.””™" — Gabrielle Carey <em><a href="https://sydneyreviewofbooks.com/breaking-james-joyce/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Breaking Up With James Joyce</a></em> Is the nature of reality binary, dual? Is it in some way Gnostic, in that good deeds have those side effects of evil, and evil deeds have some atom of good? What does Preston Howard have to say about that?

“For the first time in history, we have reached a stage of absurdity in which a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> is no longer viable as a rhetorical maneuver, for there is nothing so absurd that everyone recognizes it as such.” — <a href="http://takimag.com/article/street_corner_semantics_theodore_dalrymple/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Theodore Dalrymple</a> History covers a long time and a lot of absurdity, but this is pretty clearly true – least in my lifetime.

“The Constitution, written by men with some experience of actual government, assumes that the chief executive will work to be king, the Parliament will scheme to sell off the silverware, and the judiciary will consider itself Olympian and do everything it can to much improve (destroy) the work of the other two branches. So the Constitution pits them against each other, in the attempt not to achieve stasis, but rather to allow for the constant corrections necessary to prevent one branch from getting too much power for too long.” — <a href="https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2008/03/mamets_revelation.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">David Mamet</a>

<p>
“NO EVIL as such can be desirable, either by natural appetite or by conscious will. It is sought indirectly, namely because it is a consequence of some good. This is the rule for every type of appetite. A natural force works for a form, not the absence of form. Yet one form may extrude another. A lion kills for food, that means the death of the deer; a fornicator wants pleasure, and incurs the deformity of sin.” — St. Thomas Aquinas: <em>Summa Theologica</em>, I, q. 19, a. 9.

It is the exclusive possession of a small and disreputable minority, like knowledge, courage and honor. It takes a special sort of man to understand and enjoy liberty”” and he is usually an outlaw in democratic societies." — H. L. Mencken

Homo Economicus? <link>http://www.consultingsmiths.com/homo-economicus/</link> Mon, 15 Oct 2018 13:10:55 http://www.consultingsmiths.com/?p=1097
<p>
“Theological error is at the root of all other errors of the Modern Age. The idea that man”™s most fundamental nature is that of a homo economicus, a rational agent whose chief end is material possession, is the common basis of both economic liberalism or capitalism and socialism. At its heart it is a denial of the classical and Christian idea that man has a spiritual as well as a physical nature and that the spiritual ought to rule the animal nature. The idea that most or all of human suffering can be eliminated by reorganizing society economically, socially, and politically is rooted in the ancient heresy of Pelagianism for it is a denial of the fact that since the Fall, human nature itself has been afflicted with the flaw of Original Sin, which is the true source of all human suffering, an affliction for which there is no economic, social, or political cure." — <a href="http://thronealtarliberty.blogspot.com/2018/09/assorted-reflections.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gerry T.

“When the Church emerged from the catacombs after Constantine won the battle of the Milvan Bridge and the Church was no longer persecuted, there came freedom and, worse, respectability. So with this freedom came terrible danger, a danger that is now convulsing the Church, namely what might be called the Imperialization of the Latin West. The pagans poured into the Church. This was a new organization, albeit sacred, where future generations could climb the ladder to power and wealth.<!--more--> From the moment that the Roman Church, and to a certain extent the Byzantine Church, took on the bureaucracy of the Roman Empire as a model for its working structures, there was a foothold for the Devil. In the hands of a Gregory the Great it was safe, but when popes, cardinals, and bishops became worldly and ambitious then there was more than a whiff of danger, there were darkness and a terrible thing. What was this terrible thing? It was nothing more and nothing less than the re-crucifying of Christ, not by out and out sinners such as gangsters, murderers, and heartless dictators, but by Popes, bishops, and cardinals, and by far, far too many priests infatuated with ambition, wealth, power, and sensuality.<br />
We must reflect profoundly on the fact that the great St. John Chrysostom and the utterly gentle Robert Bellarmine thought that most bishops go to Hell. We priests are in no better state, as witnessed by that other great saint, Alphonsus Liguori, who said that most priests go to Hell. Today the great temptation among Catholics, and the mainstream Protestant churches, is the First Temptation of Christ; namely, to turn stones into bread. As long as we are involved solely in the social Gospel, then that is all that is needed. This Utopian style Christianity best incarnated in Liberation Theology is exactly what Christ speaks against, when Satan tempts Him to assuage his hunger by turning stones into bread. We must in our materialistic age reflect on Christ”™s response to Satan, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God” (Matthew 4: 4 ). When we become engrossed on feeding and clothing the World”™s population and getting everyone jobs, noble as this effort is, it is not enough. There is only one thing that is enough, and that is that we give ourselves totally and utterly to God, holding nothing back. However, because we are human most of us fail miserably, and before long there are programmes put into place that are anything but Christian. God does not ask us to be successful, he asks us to be faithful." — <a href="https://www.lifesitenews.com/opinion/awake-and-do-your-duty-a-hermits-open-letter-to-catholic-bishops-amid-abuse" rel="noopener" target="_blank">An Anonymous Hermit Priest</a>

He took me into his room, which smelt strongly of tobacco, and took out a book from one of the heaps, turned the leaves and looked for the passage. “This is good, too, very good,” he said, “listen to this: ‘A man should be proud of suffering. All suffering is a reminder of our high estate.’ Fine! Eighty years before Nietzsche. But that is not the sentence I meant. Wait a moment, here I have it. This: ‘Most men will not swim before they are able to.’ Is not that witty? Naturally, they will not swim! They are born for the solid earth, not for the water. And naturally they won’t think. They are made for life, not for thought. Yes, and he who thinks, what’s more, he who makes thought his business, he may go far in it, but he has bartered the solid earth for the water all the same, and one day he will drown.” — Hermann Hesse <em>Steppenwolf</em>

“WHAT embitters the world is not excess of criticism, but absence of self-criticism. It is comparatively of little consequence that you occasionally break out and abuse other people, so long as you do not absolve yourself. The former is a natural collapse of human weakness; the latter is a blasphemous assumption of divine power. And in the modern world, where everybody is quarrelling about the urgent necessity of peace, nobody notices how this notion has really poisoned the relations of nations and men.” — G.K. Chesterton: “On Bright Old Things and Other Things,” in <em>Sidelights on New London and Newer New York</em>.

“Stephen”™s mind wandered away on the subject of authority, its nature, origin, base or bases: authority whether innate of acquired, and if acquired then by what means? Authority as opposed to mere power, how exactly to be defined? Its etymology: its relation to <em>auctor</em>. From these thoughts he was aroused by an expectant silence opposite him, and looking up he saw Dutourd and Vidal looking at him across the table, their forks poised: reaching back in his mind he caught the echo of a question: ‘What do you think of democracy?’ ‘The gentleman was asking what you thought of democracy, sir,’ said Vidal, smiling. ‘Alas I cannot tell you, sir,’ said Stephen, returning the smile. ‘For although it would not be proper to call this barque or vessel a King”™s ship except in the largest sense, we nevertheless adhere strictly to the naval tradition which forbids discussion of religion, women, or politics in our mess. It has been objected that this rule makes insipidity, which may be so; yet on the other hand it has it uses, since in this case for example it prevents any member from wounding any other gentleman present by saying that he did not think the policy that put Socrates to death and that left Athens prostrate was the highest expression of human wisdom, or by quoting Aristotle”™s definition of democracy as mob rule, the depraved version of a commonwealth.’” — Patrick O’Brien, <em>The Wine-Dark Sea</em>

“But if we scrutinize the men of the Middle Ages more closely, contrasting them with ourselves, we shall find something yet more significant. And it is this, that they identified <em>themselves</em> with their thoughts. This is of the utmost importance. It is this that is at the bottom of all that strikes a modern observer as most incomprehensible and alien about the men of that time—for example, their intolerance. Identifying the thought with the words, they felt that truth could be wholly embodied in creed and dogma, and identifying the self with the thought, they were—quite rightly—intolerant. A wrong thought could strike them as far more immoral than a wrong action.” — Owen Barfield <em>Romanticism Comes of Age</em> p. 54

An example of a key “Barfieldian” concept — that we are profoundly different from our ancestors, that their experience of both external and interior realities was incomprehensibly different from ours.

“Many Catholics have forgotten that the Church is established for the forgiveness of sins and the proclamation of the gospel, and believe instead that the Church is here to make the world a better place, and that this needs to be accomplished by all sorts of educational, social welfare, political and even revolutionary activities. “Preachers, priests and prelates have decided Jesus’ kingdom really is of this world after all and have exchanged the gospel of salvation for the gospel of political activism. They are more concerned with saving the planet than saving souls. “Tell it straight. This is the message of anti-Christ.” — <a href="https://dwightlongenecker.com/advent-apostasy-and-the-anti-christ/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fr. Dwight Longnecker</a>

“St. Mary”™s Church in Dublin, Ireland, built at the beginning of the 18th century and closed in 1964, was abandoned for a number of years until it was bought and transformed into a restaurant and bar in 1997. The transformation was given the Dublin City Neighborhood Awards 2006, where it won first prize in the category of Best Old Building. Now it goes by the name of The Church Bar and Restaurant. “The travel destinations section of The Telegraph (London) notes that, at the historic heart of Assisi, Italy, you may enjoy the <em>Nun Assisi Relais and Spa and Museum</em>: “This stylish convent-turned-design-hotel enjoys a quiet spot in the historical heart of Assisi. An inspired renovation not only transformed the 13th-century structure into a sleek, minimalist haven; but also uncovered the ruins of a Roman amphitheater — now home to an atmospheric”˜spa museum”™.” “Can ecclesiastical buildings be recycled, re-purposed, or transformed without profanation?” — <a href="https://www.thecatholicthing.org/2018/12/13/are-churches-easily-dispensable/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ines A.

<p>
<p>“A naÃ¯ve understanding of materialism attributes to it a naÃ¯ve understanding of matter. Matter, common sense says, is more or less the way it appears to us in ordinary experience. It is solid, colored stuff that always tastes, smells, sounds, and feels a certain way. Materialism, on a naÃ¯ve understanding, is the view that everything that exists is like that. Even unobservable particles are assumed to be tiny solid, colored objects that have their own tastes, smells, sounds, and feels to them. Like little stones or marbles.</p>
“Of course, this is all wrong.” — <a href="http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2019/01/materialism-subverts-itself.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Edward Feser</a> A pretty “Barfieldian” statement for someone who seems determined to ignore Barfield, even when his name is mentioned dozens of times by his commenters. Well, ‘philosophers’ are like that.

“Surface plausibility, reasonableness, persuasiveness, enjoyability… yet all the time, underneath, nagging away at me — there a revulsion, a rising tide of suspicion. The ‘balance’ of ‘evidence’ suggests that these are ‘well-meaning’ people, saying things that have ‘some value’… yet from the start, and all the time, there is this drum-beat of inner rejection. “This is what I call That Antichrist feeling — that sense that I am here dealing with an Antichrist phenomenon… “It is the knowledge of my own heart that I am dealing with some person, institution or product that has (to some degree — perhaps unconsciously to itself) a rotten, corrupt, dishonest, manipulative heart. That is pretending to be on the side of God, while actually working against God… That is pretending to be on the side of God in order to work against God.” — <a href="http://charltonteaching.blogspot.com/2019/01/that-antichrist-feeling.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bruce Charlton</a>

“It is going-against a very mainstream — especially Protestant — view of Christianity (and the emphasis of the Apostle Paul) when I say Christianity is not — or is hardly at all — about justice. “Indeed, quite the opposite: the promise of Christ is that salvation comes to all who follow him in love — and that is a massive short-circuit of anything like justice.” — <a href="http://charltonteaching.blogspot.com/2019/01/christianity-is-not-much-about-justice.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bruce Charlton</a> Reminds me of the AA saying, “Good thing that God’s love is greater than His sense of justice — I’d hate to think where I’d be if I got what I deserve!”

“The intelligentsia was driven to create literary modernism by a profound loathing of ordinary common readers. The intellectuals feared the masses not because they were illiterate but because, by the early twentieth century, they were becoming more literate, thanks to public education, adult education, scholarships, and cheap editions of the great books. “If more and more working people were reading the classics, if they were closing the cultural gap between themselves and the middle classes, how could intellectuals preserve their elite status as arbiters of taste and custodians of rare knowledge? They had to create a new body of modernist literature which was deliberately made so difficult and obscure that the average reader did not understand it.” — <a href="https://daily.jstor.org/was-modernism-meant-to-keep-the-working-classes-out/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jonathan Rose</a> This explains Virginia Woolf, Stein and Pound. And a lot of Joyce, Kafka, Eliot. Not to mention a lot of newer stuff. Or is it just me?

“Today”™s “let”™s all get along, not judge or challenge anyone” groupthink also reminds me of a major scene sequence in Milos Forman”™s adaptation of Ken Kesey”™s 1962 novel <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo”™s Nest</em>. “Jack Nicholson portrays R.P. McMurphy, a good time Charlie with authority figure issues. He”™s playing crazy at a maximum-security insane asylum to get out of a work detail jail sentence. Years ago, they sentenced petty criminals to hard labor. I remember as a kid being in the backseat driving South and watching chain gangs cutting overgrown brush on the median of I95””Donn Pearce must have seen them too. He wrote <em>Cool Hand Luke</em>. <!--more--> “McMurphy”™s Moriarty is Nurse Ratched, the head nurse in the asylum. Louise Fletcher played this role so brilliantly””all ice and pursed lips””she had difficulty finding work after winning the Oscar for it. “One afternoon, during an interminable group therapy session, McMurphy requests that the guys be allowed to watch the World Series that evening. Knowing that the last thing the other men would want to do is stand up and challenge the way she rules her kingdom, Ratched sees an opportunity to put McMurphy in his place. “She”™ll put the request up to a vote. “McMurphy sticks his hand up to vote “yea” assuming that his fellow patients will come to the same conclusion that he has. By simply raising their arms, together the men can let this lady know that denying a simple pleasure like watching a ball game to a bunch of lunatics is absurd. “Which one of you nuts has any guts? “The needy fuser Cheswick is the only other one who has the courage to challenge Nurse Ratched”™s command. Meeting adjourned. The men are then shuttled into the shower room for their evening cleaning. McMurphy is out of his mind with anger. “If you”™re a writer, this scene is a perfect example of a set-up that dramatically portrays a character”™s inner change. How does Ken Kesey pay it off? “From the first moment McMurphy lays eyes on Ratched, the reader/viewer knows he judges her as rotten to the core. McMurphy is not afraid to judge. His problem is that he acts on his judgments too quickly. That”™s what got him in the clink in the first place. “In the nuthouse, though, he is forced to keep the judgment to himself. He”™s supposed to be crazy! And to McMurphy, only crazy people don”™t judge, so he shouldn”™t either. “But when the evidence of Ratched”™s evil is incontrovertible to him, he can”™t help himself but act. He”™s the novel”™s protagonist. He”™s the hero. If he doesn”™t act on his judgments, there”™s no story. “Kesey could have made any number of choices with this scene. He could have had McMurphy act selfishly, like a child, and physically attack a guard or an inmate or himself. Something the character has a reputation for doing earlier in his life. “Instead, for the first time (and the perfect time) Kesey has his character act beyond himself. He changes his behavior. McMurphy sees that these men have it within themselves to judge Ratched as a tyrant. If he can make them understand how important it is to make a judgment and to act on that judgment””even if it puts them in harm”™s way””he will help them. And helping them will help him bring down tyranny. He”™ll win. “McMurphy, already known as a consummate hustler, challenges all of the men to take a bet. He puts all of his money on his succeeding. He will pick up a thousand pound marble bathroom vanity, throw it through the barred window, walk to a nearby bar with his buddy Cheswick, wet his whistle and watch Mickey Mantle play in the World Series”¦Who wants some of this action? “He”™s so convincing that only the most cynical among them take his bet. “Playing McMurphy as only he could play him, Jack Nicholson grabs the edges of the vanity, squats and surges into the plumbing. He turns blue from effort. He commits to the action, gives it his best shot. When he”™s drenched with sweat, spent and defeated, he walks out of the room. But not before turning to the stunned assemblage and saying: ““At least I tried.” “As a child in the 60s and 70s, I was raised on stories like this. (I wish we had more of them today) And they”™ve had a profound influence. This is why art is so important. “These stories taught me that to passively disengage for fear of reprisal is cowardly. Making a judgment, taking a stand and then acting against an injustice or acting to support excellence is the stuff of the everyman hero.” &amp;mdash: <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2019/01/art-and-polarity/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Shawn Coyne</a>

“All problems have solutions. “That”™s what makes them problems. “The solution might involve trade-offs or expenses that you don”™t want to incur. You might choose not to solve the problem. But there is a solution. Perhaps you haven”™t found it yet. Perhaps you need to do more research or make some tradeoffs in what you”™re hoping for. “If there is no solution, then it”™s not a problem. “It”™s a regrettable situation. It”™s a boundary condition. It”™s something you”™ll need to live with. “Which might be no fun, but there”™s no sense in worrying about it or spending time or money on it, because it”™s not a problem. ““I want to go to the wedding, but it”™s a thousand miles away.” That”™s a problem. You can solve it with a plane ticket and some cancelled plans. ““I want to go to the wedding, but I”™m not willing to cancel my meeting.” That”™s not a problem. That”™s an unavoidable conflict. If you need to violate a law of physics to get out of a situation, it”™s not a problem. But you”™ve already given up turning it into a problem, so it doesn”™t pay to pretend it”™s solvable. “Once we can walk away from unsolvable situations that pretend to be problems, we can focus our energy on the real problems in front of us.” — <a href="https://seths.blog/2019/01/problems-and-boundaries/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Seth Godin</a>

“The great Greg Cochran will often point out that a smart person is someone who says smart things, but more important, they don”™t say many dumb things. Everyone, no matter how smart, will get a dumb idea in their head or get carried away and say something stupid on occasion. It”™s just not common with smart people, at least not as common as it is with dumb people. Being smart is as much the absence of stupidity as it is getting right answers or having a long list of brilliant insights. “This comes up often in public discussion of the human sciences. It is remarkable how often an allegedly smart person will say things that are laughably wrong about something in biology or human evolution.” It’s worth reading the rest at: <a href="http://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=16243" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Z Man</a> blog.

“Equality (outside mathematics) is a purely social conception. It applies to man as a political and economic animal. It has no place in the world of the mind. Beauty is not democratic””she reveals herself more to the few than to the many, more to the persistent and disciplined seekers than to the careless. Virtue is not democratic””she is achieved by those who pursue her more hotly than most men. Truth is not democratic””she demands special talents and special industry in those to whom she gives her favors. Political democracy is doomed if it tries to extend its demand for equality into these higher spheres. Ethical, intellectual, or aesthetic democracy is death.” ”” C.S. Lewis, 1944

In particular he seeks to maintain the permeation of the mind by the ‘given’, the physical, the instinctive warmth, which men bring with them from the past and must indeed use, but which should no longer permeate, or at least not involuntarily, their mental powers. You and I, my friend, have watched him at work already, for we have seen him trying to preserve into your time the psychology and the social patterns of the Gabriel age. “And what is the function, or the aim, of Ahriman? “You must distinguish the function from the aim. It is the aims of both beings that we are at present concerned with. Their aim is to oppose those whom it will suffice for the present to call the true gods; but their <em>function</em> is to serve these gods against their will, and by means of that very opposition. Do not take this lightly, or repeat it glibly. The aim of Ahriman is to anticipate the future, but which can only appear in the present as a wicked caricature. In pursuit of this aim he will persuade you, if he can, to eradicate the past instead of transforming it. He abhors tradition. History is his bane. He operates, in the present age, principally in the field of mind, leaving the feelings for Lucifer to exploit. He freezes. His purpose is to destroy everything in human thinking which depends on a certain warmth, to replace wonder by sophistication, courtesy by vulgarity, understanding by calculation, imagination by statistics.” — Owen Barfield <em>Unancestral Voice</em>

“I am suggesting therefore that what we have to think of, and what future legislation must somehow learn to deal with, is not so much a public opinion that is sharply divided in two as it is two different publics: an A public and a B public. Or that, if this is not already the case, it is rapidly becoming so; and it seems that in the near future it will be so. Anyone who has felt the pulse, so to speak, of the intellectual climate in the English-speaking world, and of the changes that have been occurring in it over the last forty or fifty years, is likely to be impressed by the circumstance that, even at the philosophical level — even, that is, when a <em>bona fide</em> attempt is made to bridge the communication gap by recognizing the presuppositions, formulating them, debating them — it generally turns out to be impossible.” — Owen Barfield <a href="http://www.owenbarfield.org/the-politics-of-abortion/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Politics of Abortion</em></a>

“‘And what about yourself?’ asked Merry.”‘Hoom, hm, I have not troubled about the Great Wars,’ said Treebeard; ‘they mostly concern Elves and Men. That is the business of Wizards: Wizards are always troubled about the future. I do not like worrying about the future. I am not altogether on anybody’s side, because nobody is altogether on my side, if you understand me: nobody cares for the woods as I care for them, not even Elves nowadays…’" — J.R.R.

At least a few of my strong memories are strongly associated with a very particular place. The bed at nine-mile, the sofa on Stanley street, the entry hall on Dale Drive. This last with just a flash, that “we” could easily take a “wrong turn” in our thoughts and carry merrily on down a “wrong” path. “Two roads diverged in a yellow wood…and that has made all the difference.” Brought to mind several times recently reading Barfield’s writing about the history of consciousness.

“They say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical persons, to make modern and familiar, things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge, when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear.” — Shakespeare, <em>All’s Well That Ends Well</em>

“And in that moment Sherman made the terrible discovery that men make about their fathers sooner or later. For the first time he realized that the man before him was not an aging father but a boy, a boy much like himself, a boy who grew up and had a child of his own and, as best he could, out of a sense of duty and, perhaps, love, adopted a role called Being a Father so that his child would have something mythical and infinitely important: a Protector, who would keep a lid on all the chaotic and catastrophic possibilities of life. And now that boy, that good actor, had grown old and fragile and tired, wearier than ever at the thought of trying to hoist the Protector”™s armor back onto his shoulders again, now, so far down the line.” — Tom Wolfe <em>Bonfire of the Vanities</em>

Magic <link>http://www.consultingsmiths.com/magic/</link> Mon, 11 Mar 2019 10:27:15 http://www.consultingsmiths.com/?p=1213
<p>
“You could say that”˜magic”™ is a recognition that you have been underestimating the world, assuming that it is boring and limited when it is your own mind that is bored and limited. And this is important, for it brings the great fundamental insight, the insight that has come to all mystics and poets : that a large part of man”™s misery and pain is his own fault. For nearly three thousand years, cynical philosophers have been declaring that human life is disappointing and brief and miserable, and that the wise man has no objection to dying. But moments of ”˜magic”™ bring a clear recognition that the world ”˜out there”™ is infinitely interesting — so interesting that if we could ”˜turn on”™ the magic at will, we would probably live for ever — or at least, want to. The magic doesn”™t get in past our senses, which have thick filters on them. Blake recognised that it is as if man lived in a cold, damp cave, when outside there is warm sunlight and fresh air. ”˜Five windows light the caverned man, through one he breathes the air . . .”™” — William Arkle <em>A Geography of Consciousness<em>

Ressentiment <link>http://www.consultingsmiths.com/ressentiment/</link> Sun, 17 Mar 2019 01:18:54 http://www.consultingsmiths.com/?p=1218
<p>
“Ressentiment is a self-poisoning of the mind which has quite definite causes and consequences. It is a lasting mental attitude, caused by the systematic repression of certain emotions and affects which, as such, are normal components of human nature. Their repression leads to the constant tendency to indulge in certain kinds of value delusions and corresponding value judgments. The emotions and affects primarily concerned are revenge, hatred, malice, envy, the impulse to detract, and spite.” — Max Scheler <em><a href="https://mercaba.org/SANLUIS/Filosofia/autores/Contempor%C3%A1nea/Scheller/Ressentiment.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ressentiment</a></em> H/T <a href="https://www.francisberger.com/bergers-blog/resentment-the-hate-fueling-contemporary-conceptions-of-love" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Francis Berger</a>

“There are some things that cannot be verified, or falsified. These would include all axioms of logic; even those of post-modern “paraconsistent” logics, wherein the very Law of Non-Contradiction is (implausibly) denied, but which are axiomatic on their own terms. We are out the door of “science” when we discuss logic; or the principles of mathematics for that matter. All we can say is that the world makes sense on axioms; and not otherwise. “For science, or human knowledge more broadly, God is not an hypothesis, but an Axiom. Start in Aristotle, if you will, to see that the world has no purchase on sense, without the Unmoved Mover. The “Five Ways” by which the inevitability of God was demonstrated by Thomas Aquinas, and the related ways in which this was done by others before and after him, are easily misunderstood, because they are not proofs of an hypothesis but recursions. They show that, without that “God Axiom,” there can be no causation, no change, no being in itself, no gradation, no direction to an end. We need a Still Point, from which to depart. It cannot be hypothesized. It is too simple for that. You need to assume it even to contradict it.” — <a href="https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2019/03/23/the-cosmic-duh/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David Warren</a>

<h1 id="sloth">Sloth</h1>
<link>http://www.consultingsmiths.com/sloth/</link> Mon, 08 Apr 2019 02:40:41 http://www.consultingsmiths.com/?p=1228
<p>
“One of the more misunderstood of the cardinal sins is sloth. Most see it merely as laziness, but there is more to it than that. Let”™s take a moment and consider some aspects of this cardinal sin. “The Greek word we translate as sloth is á¼€ÎºÎ·Î´Î¯Î± akedia (a = absence + kedos = care), meaning indifference or negligence. St. Thomas Aquinas speaks of sloth as sorrow for spiritual good. By it, we shun spiritual good as too toilsome (cf Summa Theologica II-II 35,2). “Some modern commentators describe sloth as a “don”™t care” feeling. Some even say it is a kind of falling out of love with God and the things of God (cf Rev 2:4). On account of sloth, the idea of right living and the gift of a transformed humanity inspires not joy, but aversion or even disgust because it is seen as too difficult or as requiring the setting aside of currently enjoyed or sinful pleasures. Through sloth, many experience sorrow rather than joy or zeal in following God and receiving a transformed human life. They are distressed at the prospect of what might have to occur should they embrace the faith more deeply. “Sloth also tends to dismiss the power of grace, focusing instead on the “trouble” or effort involved in walking in the Christian way. “Sloth is not merely laziness; it is more properly understood as sorrow or indifference. While sloth may sometimes look like boredom and a casual laziness toward attaining spiritual good, it can also be manifested by a frantic “busyness” with worldly things so as to avoid spiritual questions or living a reflective life.” — <a href="http://blog.adw.org/2019/04/seven-deadly-sins-sloth/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Msgr. Charles Pope</a>

“What with history being rewritten so often, nobody knows what is true anymore. They lose track of who is an enemy and who an ally. It’s that kind of story.” ““They rewrite history.” ““Robbing people of their actual history is the same as robbing them of part of themselves. It’s a crime.” “Fuka-Eri thought about that for a moment. “Tengo went on, “Our memory is made up of our individual memories and our collective memories. The two are intimately linked. And history is our collective memory. If our collective memory is taken from us—is rewritten—we lose the ability to sustain our true selves.”” — Haruki Murakami <em>1Q84</em>

<h1 id="ignorance">Ignorance</h1>
<p>Sat, 13 Apr 2019 “Our comforting conviction that the world makes sense rests on a secure foundation: our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance.” — Daniel Kahneman</p>
<h1 id="owen-barfield">Owen Barfield</h1>
<p>Sat. 27 Apr 2019 Owen Barfield (1898–1997) Our destiny is to become both conscious and free.</p>
<p>Barfield was writing for everybody and for all time — his core concern was nothing less than the divine destiny of each individual person and of all people collectively.</p>
<p>Barfield’s immediate relevance is profound; it is to solve the core problem of modern times - which is ‘alienation’: i.e. the deep sense of meaninglessness, purposelessness, and isolation from people and things.</p>
<p>The understanding which makes this possible is that history, the present and the future can be understood as aiming at both consciousness and freedom (where consciousness means awareness of our thinking and ourselves, and freedom refers to free will, or human agency).</p>
<p>Barfield’s scheme is that humans began as conscious-but-not-free; and we evolved — evolved in the sense of changing by unfolding according to a (divine) developmental plan — to become free but not conscious (which is where we are now, in modern times — unaware of meaning, purpose, relation) — and we ought to be aiming at the condition where we are both self-aware and fully-conscious. Engaged with (and participating in) reality as free agents.</p>
<p>Even more briefly, humanity began as conscious, became free; and is destined to become both — simultaneously.</p>
<p>Barfield proposes real, coherent, and clear answers to the most fundamental problems.</p>

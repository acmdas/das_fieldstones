## What&#039;s the Matter?
Fri, 11 Jan 2019

&ldquo;A naive understanding of materialism attributes to it a naive understanding of matter.  Matter, common sense says, is more or less the way it appears to us in ordinary experience.  It is solid, colored stuff that always tastes, smells, sounds, and feels a certain way.  Materialism, on a naÃ¯ve understanding, is the view that everything that exists is like that.  Even unobservable particles are assumed to be tiny solid, colored objects that have their own tastes, smells, sounds, and feels to them.  Like little stones or marbles.
  
&ldquo;Of course, this is all wrong.&rdquo;&mdash;[Edward Feser](http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2019/01/materialism-subverts-itself.html)

A pretty &ldquo;Barfieldian&rdquo; statement for someone who seems determined to ignore Barfield, even when his name is mentioned dozens of times by his commenters. Well, &lsquo;philosophers&rsquo; are like that.

## That Antichrist Feeling
Sun, 13 Jan 2019

&ldquo;Surface plausibility, reasonableness, persuasiveness, enjoyability... yet all the time, underneath, nagging away at me&mdash;there a revulsion, a rising tide of suspicion. The 'balance' of 'evidence' suggests that these are 'well-meaning' people, saying things that have 'some value'... yet from the start, and all the time, there is this drum-beat of inner rejection.
&ldquo;This is what I call That Antichrist feeling&mdash;that sense that I am here dealing with an Antichrist phenomenon...
&ldquo;It is the knowledge of my own heart that I am dealing with some person, institution or product that has (to some degree&mdash;perhaps unconsciously to itself) a rotten, corrupt, dishonest, manipulative heart. That is pretending to be on the side of God, while actually working against God... That is pretending to be on the side of God in order to work against God.&rdquo;&mdash;[Bruce Charlton](http://charltonteaching.blogspot.com/2019/01/that-antichrist-feeling.html)

## Justice or Love
Sun, 13 Jan 2019

&ldquo;It is going-against a very mainstream&mdash;especially Protestant&mdash;view of Christianity (and the emphasis of the Apostle Paul) when I say Christianity is not&mdash;or is hardly at all&mdash;about justice.
&ldquo;Indeed, quite the opposite: the promise of Christ is that salvation comes to all who follow him in love&mdash;and that is a massive short-circuit of anything like justice.&rdquo;&mdash;[Bruce Charlton](http://charltonteaching.blogspot.com/2019/01/christianity-is-not-much-about-justice.html)

Reminds me of the AA saying, &ldquo;Good thing that God&rsquo;s love is greater than His sense of justice&mdash;I&rsquo;d hate to think where I&rsquo;d be if I got what I deserve!&rdquo;

## Modern Lit
Sun, 13 Jan 2019

&ldquo;The intelligentsia was driven to create literary modernism by a profound loathing of ordinary common readers. The intellectuals feared the masses not because they were illiterate but because, by the early twentieth century, they were becoming more literate, thanks to public education, adult education, scholarships, and cheap editions of the great books.

&ldquo;If more and more working people were reading the classics, if they were closing the cultural gap between themselves and the middle classes, how could intellectuals preserve their elite status as arbiters of taste and custodians of rare knowledge? They had to create a new body of modernist literature which was deliberately made so difficult and obscure that the average reader did not understand it.&rdquo;&mdash;[Jonathan Rose](https://daily.jstor.org/was-modernism-meant-to-keep-the-working-classes-out/)

This explains Virginia Woolf, Stein and Pound. And a lot of Joyce, Kafka, Eliot. Not to mention a lot of newer stuff. Or is it just me?

## The State of Current Science
Tue, 15 Jan 2019

&ldquo;Modern, Linear Faustian Science has run it&rsquo;s course. The decline is obviously visible when the spokesmanship passes from Albert Einstein to Carl Sagan to Neil DeGrasse Tyson. It&rsquo;s been about 40 years since we really smashed through any scientific barriers. &rdquo;&mdash;[Jonathan Wilkinson](http://www.amerika.org/politics/periscope-january-11-2019/)

## Judging
Fri, 18 Jan 2019

&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s &ldquo;let&rsquo;s all get along, not judge or challenge anyone&rdquo; groupthink also reminds me of a major scene sequence in Milos Forman&rsquo;s adaptation of Ken Kesey&rsquo;s 1962 novel <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo&rsquo;s Nest</em>.

&ldquo;Jack Nicholson portrays R.P. McMurphy, a good time Charlie with authority figure issues. He&rsquo;s playing crazy at a maximum-security insane asylum to get out of a work detail jail sentence. Years ago, they sentenced petty criminals to hard labor. I remember as a kid being in the backseat driving South and watching chain gangs cutting overgrown brush on the median of I95&mdash;Donn Pearce must have seen them too. He wrote <em>Cool Hand Luke</em>.

&ldquo;McMurphy&rsquo;s Moriarty is Nurse Ratched, the head nurse in the asylum. Louise Fletcher played this role so brilliantly&mdash;all ice and pursed lips&mdash;she had difficulty finding work after winning the Oscar for it.

&ldquo;One afternoon, during an interminable group therapy session, McMurphy requests that the guys be allowed to watch the World Series that evening. Knowing that the last thing the other men would want to do is stand up and challenge the way she rules her kingdom, Ratched sees an opportunity to put McMurphy in his place.

&ldquo;She&rdquo;ll put the request up to a vote.

&ldquo;McMurphy sticks his hand up to vote &ldquo;yea&rdquo; assuming that his fellow patients will come to the same conclusion that he has.  By simply raising their arms, together the men can let this lady know that denying a simple pleasure like watching a ball game to a bunch of lunatics is absurd.

&ldquo;Which one of you nuts has any guts?

&ldquo;The needy fuser Cheswick is the only other one who has the courage to challenge Nurse Ratched&rsquo;s command. Meeting adjourned. The men are then shuttled into the shower room for their evening cleaning. McMurphy is out of his mind with anger.

&ldquo;If you&rdquo;re a writer, this scene is a perfect example of a set-up that dramatically portrays a character&rsquo;s inner change.  How does Ken Kesey pay it off?

&ldquo;From the first moment McMurphy lays eyes on Ratched, the reader/viewer knows he judges her as rotten to the core. McMurphy is not afraid to judge. His problem is that he acts on his judgments too quickly. That&rsquo;s what got him in the clink in the first place.

&ldquo;In the nuthouse, though, he is forced to keep the judgment to himself. He&rsquo;s supposed to be crazy! And to McMurphy, only crazy people don&rsquo;t judge, so he shouldn&rsquo;t either.

&ldquo;But when the evidence of Ratched&rsquo;s evil is incontrovertible to him, he can&rsquo;t help himself but act. He&rsquo;s the novel&rsquo;s protagonist. He&rsquo;s the hero. If he doesn&rsquo;t act on his judgments, there&rsquo;s no story.

&ldquo;Kesey could have made any number of choices with this scene. He could have had McMurphy act selfishly, like a child, and physically attack a guard or an inmate or himself. Something the character has a reputation for doing earlier in his life.

&ldquo;Instead, for the first time (and the perfect time) Kesey has his character act beyond himself. He changes his behavior. McMurphy sees that these men have it within themselves to judge Ratched as a tyrant. If he can make them understand how important it is to make a judgment and to act on that judgment&mdash;even if it puts them in harm&rsquo;s way&mdash;he will help them. And helping them will help him bring down tyranny. He&rdquo;ll win.

&ldquo;McMurphy, already known as a consummate hustler, challenges all of the men to take a bet. He puts all of his money on his succeeding. He will pick up a thousand pound marble bathroom vanity, throw it through the barred window, walk to a nearby bar with his buddy Cheswick, wet his whistle and watch Mickey Mantle play in the World Series&rdquo;¦Who wants some of this action?

&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so convincing that only the most cynical among them take his bet.

&ldquo;Playing McMurphy as only he could play him, Jack Nicholson grabs the edges of the vanity, squats and surges into the plumbing. He turns blue from effort.  He commits to the action, gives it his best shot. When he&rsquo;s drenched with sweat, spent and defeated, he walks out of the room.  But not before turning to the stunned assemblage and saying:

&ldquo;&ldquo;At least I tried.&rdquo;

&ldquo;As a child in the 60s and 70s, I was raised on stories like this. (I wish we had more of them today) And they&rdquo;ve had a profound influence. This is why art is so important.

&ldquo;These stories taught me that to passively disengage for fear of reprisal is cowardly. Making a judgment, taking a stand and then acting against an injustice or acting to support excellence is the stuff of the everyman hero.&rdquo;&mdash;[Shawn Coyne](https://stevenpressfield.com/2019/01/art-and-polarity/)

## Problems and Boundaries
Fri, 18 Jan 2019

&ldquo;All problems have solutions.

&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what makes them problems.

&ldquo;The solution might involve trade-offs or expenses that you don&rsquo;t want to incur. You might choose not to solve the problem. But there is a solution. Perhaps you haven&rsquo;t found it yet. Perhaps you need to do more research or make some tradeoffs in what you&rdquo;re hoping for.

&ldquo;If there is no solution, then it&rsquo;s not a problem.

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a regrettable situation. It&rsquo;s a boundary condition. It&rsquo;s something you&rdquo;ll need to live with.

&ldquo;Which might be no fun, but there&rsquo;s no sense in worrying about it or spending time or money on it, because it&rsquo;s not a problem.

&ldquo;&ldquo;I want to go to the wedding, but it&rsquo;s a thousand miles away.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a problem. You can solve it with a plane ticket and some cancelled plans.

&ldquo;&ldquo;I want to go to the wedding, but I&rdquo;m not willing to cancel my meeting.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not a problem. That&rsquo;s an unavoidable conflict. If you need to violate a law of physics to get out of a situation, it&rsquo;s not a problem. But you&rdquo;ve already given up turning it into a problem, so it doesn&rsquo;t pay to pretend it&rsquo;s solvable.

&ldquo;Once we can walk away from unsolvable situations that pretend to be problems, we can focus our energy on the real problems in front of us.&rdquo;&mdash;[Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/2019/01/problems-and-boundaries/)

## Joining Forces
Wed, 23 Jan 2019

 &ldquo;There are plagues, and there are victims, and it's the duty of good men not to join forces with the plagues.&rdquo;&mdash;Albert Camus, <em>The Plague</em>

## Incredibly Stupid Smart People
Thu, 24 Jan 2019

&ldquo;The great Greg Cochran will often point out that a smart person is someone who says smart things, but more important, they don&rsquo;t say many dumb things. Everyone, no matter how smart, will get a dumb idea in their head or get carried away and say something stupid on occasion. It&rsquo;s just not common with smart people, at least not as common as it is with dumb people. Being smart is as much the absence of stupidity as it is getting right answers or having a long list of brilliant insights.

&ldquo;This comes up often in public discussion of the human sciences. It is remarkable how often an allegedly smart person will say things that are laughably wrong about something in biology or human evolution.&rdquo;
It's worth reading the rest at: [The Z Man](http://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=16243) blog.

## Equality (outside mathematics)
Thu, 24 Jan 2019

&ldquo;Equality (outside mathematics) is a purely social conception. It applies to man as a political and economic animal. It has no place in the world of the mind. Beauty is not democratic; she reveals herself more to the few than to the many, more to the persistent and disciplined seekers than to the careless. Virtue is not democratic; she is achieved by those who pursue her more hotly than most men. Truth is not democratic; she demands special talents and special industry in those to whom she gives her favors. Political democracy is doomed if it tries to extend its demand for equality into these higher spheres. Ethical, intellectual, or aesthetic democracy is death.&rdquo;&mdash;C.S. Lewis, 1944

## Democratic Education
Thu, 24 Jan 2019

&ldquo;Democratic education, says Aristotle, ought to mean, not the education which democrats like, but the education which will preserve democracy. Until we have realized that the two things do not necessarily go together we cannot think clearly about education.&rdquo;&mdash;C.S. Lewis

## Collectives
Thu, 24 Jan 2019

&ldquo;As long as we are thinking of natural values we must say that the sun looks down on nothing half so good as a household laughing together over a meal, or two friends talking over a pint of beer, or a man alone reading a book that interests him; and that all economies, politics, laws, armies, and institutions, save insofar as they prolong and multiply such scenes, are a mere ploughing the sand and sowing the ocean, a meaningless vanity and vexation of the spirit. Collective activities are, of course, necessary, but this is the end to which they are necessary.&rdquo;&mdash;C.S. Lewis, &ldquo;Membership&rdquo; in <em>The Weight of Glory</em>

## Lucifer and Ahriman
Wed, 30 Jan 2019

&ldquo;The aim of Lucifer is to conserve the past too long; to maintain, in the present, conditions that rightly obtained in the past, but should now be superseded. He adores tradition. In particular he seeks to maintain the permeation of the mind by the 'given', the physical, the instinctive warmth, which men bring with them from the past and must indeed use, but which should no longer permeate, or at least not involuntarily, their mental powers. You and I, my friend, have watched him at work already, for we have seen him trying to preserve into your time the psychology and the social patterns of the Gabriel age.

&ldquo;And what is the function, or the aim, of Ahriman?

&ldquo;You must distinguish the function from the aim. It is the aims of both beings that we are at present concerned with. Their aim is to oppose those whom it will suffice for the present to call the true gods; but their <em>function</em> is to serve these gods against their will, and by means of that very opposition. Do not take this lightly, or repeat it glibly. The aim of Ahriman is to anticipate the future, but which can only appear in the present as a wicked caricature. In pursuit of this aim he will persuade you, if he can, to eradicate the past instead of transforming it. He abhors tradition. History is his bane. He operates, in the present age, principally in the field of mind, leaving the feelings for Lucifer to exploit. He freezes. His purpose is to destroy everything in human thinking which depends on a certain warmth, to replace wonder by sophistication, courtesy by vulgarity, understanding by calculation, imagination by statistics.&rdquo;&mdash;Owen Barfield <em>Unancestral Voice</em>

## Politics
Wed, 30 Jan 2019

&ldquo;I am suggesting therefore that what we have to think of, and what future legislation must somehow learn to deal with, is not so much a public opinion that is sharply divided in two as it is two different publics: an A public and a B public. Or that, if this is not already the case, it is rapidly becoming so; and it seems that in the near future it will be so. Anyone who has felt the pulse, so to speak, of the intellectual climate in the English-speaking world, and of the changes that have been occurring in it over the last forty or fifty years, is likely to be impressed by the circumstance that, even at the philosophical level&mdash;even, that is, when a <em>bona fide</em> attempt is made to bridge the communication gap by recognizing the presuppositions, formulating them, debating them&mdash;it generally turns out to be impossible.&rdquo;&mdash;Owen Barfield [*The Politics of Abortion*](http://www.owenbarfield.org/the-politics-of-abortion/)

## Being an Ent
Sat, 02 Feb 2019

"'And what about yourself?' asked Merry.

"'Hoom, hm, I have not troubled about the Great Wars,' said Treebeard; 'they mostly concern Elves and Men. That is the business of Wizards: Wizards are always troubled about the future. I do not like worrying about the future. I am not altogether on anybody's side, because nobody is altogether on my side, if you understand me: nobody cares for the woods as I care for them, not even Elves nowadays...'"&mdash;J.R.R. Tolkien, <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</em>, book 3, chapter IV

## Location, Location, Location
Sat, 02 Feb 2019

At least a few of my strong memories are strongly associated with a very particular place. The bed at nine-mile, the sofa on Stanley street, the entry hall on Dale Drive.

This last with just a flash, that "we" could easily take a "wrong turn" in our thoughts and carry merrily on down a "wrong" path. "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood...and that has made all the difference."

Brought to mind several times recently reading Barfield's writing about the history of consciousness.

## Miracles
Sat, 09 Feb 2019

&ldquo;They say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical persons, to make modern and familiar, things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge, when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear.&rdquo;&mdash;Shakespeare, *All&rsquo;s Well That Ends Well*

## God Is Not
Thu, 14 Feb 2019

&ldquo;God is not a lesson plan or an intellectual construct. God is not one more thing to do well at, God is someone&mdash;or something&mdash;we meet, each in our own way.&rdquo;&mdash;Julia Cameron, <em>God Is No Laughing Matter</em>

## Seen Online

youngster: "Well?"

David's comment -- well, some of it seemed important&mdash;it was for work, after all, but mostly, yeah.

## Fathers and Sons
Fri, 01 Mar 2019

&ldquo;And in that moment Sherman made the terrible discovery that men make about their fathers sooner or later. For the first time he realized that the man before him was not an aging father but a boy, a boy much like himself, a boy who grew up and had a child of his own and, as best he could, out of a sense of duty and, perhaps, love, adopted a role called Being a Father so that his child would have something mythical and infinitely important: a Protector, who would keep a lid on all the chaotic and catastrophic possibilities of life. And now that boy, that good actor, had grown old and fragile and tired, wearier than ever at the thought of trying to hoist the Protector&rsquo;s armor back onto his shoulders again, now, so far down the line.&rdquo;&mdash;Tom Wolfe <em>Bonfire of the Vanities</em>

## Boring and Dangerous
Wed, 06 Mar 2019

&ldquo;Life is intrinsically, well, boring and dangerous at the same time &rdquo;¦ At any given moment the floor may open up. Of course, it almost never does; that&rsquo;s what makes it so boring.&rdquo;&mdash;Edward J. Gorey

## Magic
Mon, 11 Mar 2019

&ldquo;You could say that &ldquo;magic&rdquo; is a recognition that you have been underestimating the world, assuming that it is boring and limited when it is your own mind that is bored and limited. And this is important, for it brings the great fundamental insight, the insight that has come to all mystics and poets : that a large part of man&rsquo;s misery and pain is his own fault. For nearly three thousand years, cynical philosophers have been declaring that human life is disappointing and brief and miserable, and that the wise man has no objection to dying. But moments of &ldquo;magic&rdquo; bring a clear recognition that the world &ldquo;out there&rdquo; is infinitely interesting&mdash;so interesting that if we could &ldquo;turn on&rdquo; the magic at will, we would probably live for ever&mdash;or at least, want to. The magic doesn&rsquo;t get in past our senses, which have thick filters on them. Blake recognised that it is as if man lived in a cold, damp cave, when outside there is warm sunlight and fresh air. &ldquo;Five windows light the caverned man, through one he breathes the air . . .&rdquo;&rdquo;&mdash;William Arkle <em>A Geography of Consciousness</em>

## Ressentiment
Sun, 17 Mar 2019

&ldquo;Ressentiment is a self-poisoning of the mind which has quite definite causes and consequences. It is a lasting mental attitude, caused by the systematic repression of certain emotions and affects which, as such, are normal components of human nature. Their repression leads to the constant tendency to indulge in certain kinds of value delusions and corresponding value judgments. The emotions and affects primarily concerned are revenge, hatred, malice, envy, the impulse to detract, and spite.&rdquo;&mdash;Max Scheler [*Ressentiment*](https://mercaba.org/SANLUIS/Filosofia/autores/Contempor%C3%A1nea/Scheller/Ressentiment.pdf)

## Increasingly Meaningless Words and Phrases
Thu, 21 Mar 2019

&ldquo;As far as I can tell, the words contained in the list below no longer define what they are meant to define.

* moral authority
* freedom
* human rights
* democracy
* values
* justice
* philanthropist

&ldquo;I hear these words repeated ad nauseam every day, yet I rarely perceive the things they are meant to delineate. What a truly confusing time to be alive.&rdquo;&mdash;[Francis Berger](https://www.francisberger.com/bergers-blog/increasingly-amorphous-words-and-phrases)

## Axiomatic
Sun, 24 Mar 2019

&ldquo;There are some things that cannot be verified, or falsified. These would include all axioms of logic; even those of post-modern &ldquo;paraconsistent&rdquo; logics, wherein the very Law of Non-Contradiction is (implausibly) denied, but which are axiomatic on their own terms. We are out the door of &ldquo;science&rdquo; when we discuss logic; or the principles of mathematics for that matter. All we can say is that the world makes sense on axioms; and not otherwise.

&ldquo;For science, or human knowledge more broadly, God is not an hypothesis, but an Axiom. Start in Aristotle, if you will, to see that the world has no purchase on sense, without the Unmoved Mover. The &ldquo;Five Ways&rdquo; by which the inevitability of God was demonstrated by Thomas Aquinas, and the related ways in which this was done by others before and after him, are easily misunderstood, because they are not proofs of an hypothesis but recursions. They show that, without that &ldquo;God Axiom,&rdquo; there can be no causation, no change, no being in itself, no gradation, no direction to an end. We need a Still Point, from which to depart. It cannot be hypothesized. It is too simple for that. You need to assume it even to contradict it.&rdquo;&mdash;[David Warren](https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2019/03/23/the-cosmic-duh/)

## Sloth
Mon, 08 Apr 2019

&ldquo;One of the more misunderstood of the cardinal sins is sloth. Most see it merely as laziness, but there is more to it than that. Let&rsquo;s take a moment and consider some aspects of this cardinal sin.

&ldquo;The Greek word we translate as sloth is á¼€ÎºÎ·Î´Î¯Î± akedia (a = absence + kedos = care), meaning indifference or negligence. St. Thomas Aquinas speaks of sloth as sorrow for spiritual good. By it, we shun spiritual good as too toilsome (cf Summa Theologica II-II 35,2).

&ldquo;Some modern commentators describe sloth as a &ldquo;don&rsquo;t care&rdquo; feeling. Some even say it is a kind of falling out of love with God and the things of God (cf Rev 2:4). On account of sloth, the idea of right living and the gift of a transformed humanity inspires not joy, but aversion or even disgust because it is seen as too difficult or as requiring the setting aside of currently enjoyed or sinful pleasures. Through sloth, many experience sorrow rather than joy or zeal in following God and receiving a transformed human life. They are distressed at the prospect of what might have to occur should they embrace the faith more deeply.

&ldquo;Sloth also tends to dismiss the power of grace, focusing instead on the &ldquo;trouble&rdquo; or effort involved in walking in the Christian way.

&ldquo;Sloth is not merely laziness; it is more properly understood as sorrow or indifference. While sloth may sometimes look like boredom and a casual laziness toward attaining spiritual good, it can also be manifested by a frantic &ldquo;busyness&rdquo; with worldly things so as to avoid spiritual questions or living a reflective life.&rdquo;&mdash;[Msgr. Charles Pope](http://blog.adw.org/2019/04/seven-deadly-sins-sloth/)

## History
Tue, 09 Apr 2019

&ldquo;What with history being rewritten so often, nobody knows what is true anymore. They lose track of who is an enemy and who an ally. It&rsquo;s that kind of story.&rdquo;

&ldquo;&ldquo;They rewrite history.&rdquo;

&ldquo;&ldquo;Robbing people of their actual history is the same as robbing them of part of themselves. It&rsquo;s a crime.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Fuka-Eri thought about that for a moment.

&ldquo;Tengo went on, &ldquo;Our memory is made up of our individual memories and our collective memories. The two are intimately linked. And history is our collective memory. If our collective memory is taken from us&mdash;is rewritten&mdash;we lose the ability to sustain our true selves.&rdquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Haruki Murakami <em>1Q84</em>


## The Second Bowl
Fri, 12 Apr 2019

&ldquo;I broke two bowls today.

&ldquo;I was emptying the dishwasher, holding both small clean bowls in one hand. One of them slipped, and I watched, aghast, as it started to fall in slow motion toward the hard kitchen floor.

&ldquo;In a valiant but vain attempt to miraculously catch the bowl, I dropped the second one as well.

&ldquo;Now both were gone.

&ldquo;Often, the best thing to do with a lost cause is to let it go. Because pursuing it gets in the way of the causes you haven&rsquo;t lost yet.&rdquo;&mdash;[Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/2019/04/the-second-bowl/)

## Ignorance
Sat, 13 Apr 2019

&ldquo;Our comforting conviction that the world makes sense rests on a secure foundation: our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance.&rdquo;&mdash;Daniel Kahneman

## Audacity
Sat, 13 Apr 2019

“If you are inclined - late in life though it be - to reconnoitre a foreign sphere of limitless extent, then be persuaded that the first quality that is needed is Audacity. There really is no time for the deliberate approach...We must not be too ambitious. We cannot aspire to masterpieces. We may content ourselves with a joy ride. And for this Audacity is the only ticket.”&mdash;W. S. Churchill&mdash;*Painting as a Pastime*

## Scare Quotes
Wed, 17 Apr 2019

Students exist who will scare quote “right,” “wrong,” “good,” and “evil,” as though one were talking about gnomes, trolls and “‘cultural’ studies.” — [Richard Cocks](https://orthosphere.wordpress.com/2019/04/17/berdyaev-summer-camp/)

## Deus vult - an Easter Morning Thought
Sun, Apr 21, 2019

One of those “blasts from the past” that seem like original-to-me thoughts (as in I don’t remember reading them first) which I recall with complete visual memory of where I was when they first came to me. Location is the office at Saint Saviour’s Pro-Cathedral in Nelson, BC. Late winter or very early spring (slushy snow in the street), early 1980s.

“Christ didn’t die to convince God to love us — He died to convince us that God loved us.”

I am, in general, disinclined to give too much value to detailed theological/philosophical analysis of the inner-workings of the Creator — the interaction of the Persons of the Trinity, which Person spoke to Moses, Who divided the waters, etc., so I won’t further analyze or defend that thought. John 14:15 seems an adequate entry point to a Holy life: “If ye love me, keep my commandments.”

We can analyze what the commandments are, and how to keep them in a particular circumstance without delving into why He considers them important, or which Person originated or communicated them. “Our Lord Jesus Christ said: Hear O Israel, The Lord our God is one Lord; and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it: Thou shalt love your neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets”

## Pagan Gods
Sun, 21 Apr 2019

“MEN do not live long without gods; when the gods of the New Paganism come they will not be merely insufficient, as were the gods of Greece, nor merely false; they will be evil. One might put it in a sentence, and say that the New Paganism, foolishly expecting satisfaction, will fall, before it knows where it is, into Satanism.” — Hilaire Belloc: *Essays of a Catholic*.

## Owen Barfield
Sat, 27 Apr 2019

Owen Barfield (1898–1997)
Our destiny is to become both conscious and free.

Barfield was writing for everybody and for all time — his core concern was nothing less than the divine destiny of each individual person and of all people collectively.

Barfield's immediate relevance is profound; it is to solve the core problem of modern times - which is 'alienation': i.e. the deep sense of meaninglessness, purposelessness, and isolation from people and things.

The understanding which makes this possible is that history, the present and the future can be understood as aiming at both consciousness and freedom (where consciousness means awareness of our thinking and ourselves, and freedom refers to free will, or human agency).

Barfield's scheme is that humans began as conscious-but-not-free; and we evolved — evolved in the sense of changing by unfolding according to a (divine) developmental plan — to become free but not conscious (which is where we are now, in modern times — unaware of meaning, purpose, relation) — and we ought to be aiming at the condition where we are both self-aware and fully-conscious. Engaged with (and participating in) reality as free agents.

Even more briefly, humanity began as conscious, became free; and is destined to become both — simultaneously.

Barfield proposes real, coherent, and clear answers to the most fundamental problems.

## No Big Thing
Wed, 1 May, 2019

&ldquo;I have found that one of my favorite quotes from St. Augustine is not all that well known. Here it is in Latin, followed by my own translation:

Quod minimum, minimum est,
Sed in minimo fidelem esse,
magnum est.

What is a little thing, is (just) a little thing.
But to be faithful in a little thing
is a great thing.&rdquo;&mdash;[Msgr. Charles Pope](http://blog.adw.org/2019/05/greatness-little-things-reflection-quote-st-augustine/) (from St. Augustine’s De Doctrina Christiana, IV, 35)

## The Past
Sat, 4 May, 2019

"The past is a foreign country; They do things different there."&mdash;L. P. Hartley <em>The Go-Between</em>

## Change
Sun, 5 May, 2019

"A changeless society would be as intolerable for people as the present society of constant change. Convivial reconstruction requires limits on the rate of compulsory change. An unlimited rate of change makes lawful community meaningless. Law is based on the retrospective judgment of peers about circumstances that occur ordinarily and are likely to occur again. If the rate of change which affects all circumstances accelerates beyond some point, such judgments cease to be valid. Lawful society breaks down. Social control does not accommodate community participation and becomes the function of experts. Educators define how people are to be trained and retrained throughout their lives—shaped and reshaped until they fit the demands of industry and are attracted by its profits. Ideologues define what is right or wrong. The tooling of man for the milieu becomes the major industry when this milieu changes beyond a certain rate; then man’s need for language and law, for memories and myths, imposes limits to the change of tools."—Ivan Illich, <em>Tools for Conviviality</em>

## Knavish Imbecility
Sun, 5 May, 2019

“The Catholic Church is an institution I am bound to hold divine — but for unbelievers a proof of its divinity might be found in the fact that no merely human institution conducted with such knavish imbecility would have lasted a fortnight.”&mdash;Hilaire Belloc (A comment made to William Temple, quoted in The Life of Hilaire Belloc by Robert Speaight)

## Serenity vs Apathy
Sun, 5 May, 2019

&ldquo;Serenity is not the same as apathy, although both words denote a state that is beyond caring. One difference is that serenity is cheerful and apathy is gloomy. The serene man has overcome the world, whereas the apathetic man has been overcome by it.  Both men have lost their ambitions, but the serene man left them behind, like a newspaper on a park bench, whereas the apathetic man had them torn from his fingers in a desperate but losing fight with a band of wild banditti.&rdquo;&mdash;[J. M. Smith](https://orthosphere.wordpress.com/2019/05/05/divest-yourself-or-be-divested/)

## Regardless Power
Sun, 5 May, 2019

&ldquo;I am, however, equally troubled by another specter, another threat. I'm not sure what to call it, perhaps the threat of emancipatory technics, the emancipation here being something like the total emancipation from our embodied-in-the-world human condition. Together they constitute what I think of as the Charybdis and Scylla of the modern techo-social order. What I have in mind here is the development and deployment of technology without any regard for the givenness of our condition (any, I should note, does a lot of work in this sentence). We might also refer to the temptation of what Albert Borgmann has termed "regardless power" or, as Katherine Hayles once put it, to view our bodies as "fashion accessories rather than the ground of being." It seems to me that such power is, yes, problematic whether it is authoritarian or democratic. I am, in other words, indiscriminately suspicious of post-humanist fantasies whatever their ideological sources. 

&ldquo;I suppose one way of thinking about all of this is to ask whether it might not be best to respect the integrity of each component in the circuit I described above: mind, body, technology, world. That presupposes, of course, that we might be able to arrive at some meaningful understanding of what such integrity might entail. (Needless to say, I think we are just beginning a hard lesson in what happens when we do not respect the integrity of the world, a lesson which will not be halted by our inability to get a theoretical handle on nature's integrity.) Or, to put it another way, should we yield to the temptation of allowing our minds and our technology to act in tandem without any regard to the limits implicit in our being bodies in the world?&rdquo;&mdash;[L. M. Sacasas](https://tinyletter.com/lmsacasas/letters/the-convivial-society-no-14)

## Creeds Must Disagree
Sun, 5 May 2019

&ldquo;CREEDS must disagree: it is the whole fun of the thing. If I think the universe is triangular, and you think it is square, there cannot be room for two universes. We may argue politely, we may argue humanely, we may argue with great mutual benefit; but, obviously, we must argue. Modern toleration is really a tyranny. It is a tyranny because it is a silence. To say that I must not deny my opponent's faith is to say I must not discuss it . . . It is absurd to have a discussion on Comparative Religions if you don't compare them.&rdquo;&mdash;G.K. Chesterton: *Illustrated London News, Oct. 10, 1908.*

## The Myth as Enemy
Mon, 6 May 2019

&ldquo;The great enemy of truth is very often not the lie -- deliberate, contrived and dishonest -- but the myth -- persistent, persuasive and unrealistic. Too often we hold fast to the clichés of our forebears. We subject all facts to a prefabricated set of interpretations. We enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought.&rdquo;&mdash;John F. Kennedy *Commencement Address at Yale University, 11 June, 1962*

## The Human Mind Needs
Mon, 6 May 2019

&ldquo;NOW the human mind needs&mdash;─if it would be united to God&mdash;the guidance of the things of sense; for as the apostle says to the Romans (1:20): &lsquo;The invisible things of him are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made.&rsquo; Hence in divine worship  it is necessary to make use of certain corporal acts, so that by their means, as by certain signs, man&rsquo;s mind may be stirred up to those spiritual acts whereby it is knit to God. Consequently religion has certain interior acts which are its chief ones and which essentially belong to it; but it has also external which are secondary and which are subordinated to the interior acts.&rdquo;&mdash;St. Thomas Aquinas: *Summa Theologica, II-II, 81, 7.*

## Romanticizing the Past
Mon, 6 May 2019

&ldquo;I understand the impulse, I really do. I think it was from Alan Jacobs that I first learned about the poet W. H. Auden’s distinction between those whose tendency is to look longingly back at some better age in the past and those who look hopefully toward some ideal future:  Arcadians and Utopians respectively, he called them. Auden took these to be matters of temperament. If so, then I would readily admit to being temperamentally Arcadian. For that reason, I think I well understand the temptation and try to be on guard against it.&rdquo;&mdash;[L. M. Sacasas](https://thefrailestthing.com/2019/02/06/dont-romanticize-the-present/)

## More Huxley than Orwell
Mon, 6 May 2019

&ldquo;*Fahrenheit 451* isn’t really about censorship, after all, and it’s unfortunate that the novel has been reduced to that theme in the popular imagination.

&ldquo;Bradbury makes clear that the firemen who famously start fires to burn books are doing so only long after people stopped reading books of their own accord as other forms of media came to dominate their experience. Actually, to be more precise, they did not stop reading altogether. They stopped reading certain kinds of books: the ones that made demands of the reader, intellectual, emotional, moral demands that might upset their fragile sense of well-being.

&ldquo;*Fahrenheit 451*, in other words, is more Huxley than Orwell.&rdquo;&mdash;[L. M. Sacasas](https://thefrailestthing.com/2018/06/15/were-reading-fahrenheit-451-wrong/)

## Gell-Mann Amnesia
Mon, 6 May 2019

&ldquo;Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray's case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward—reversing cause and effect. I call these the "wet streets cause rain" stories. Paper's full of them.

&ldquo;In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.&rdquo;&mdash;Michael Crichton

## Every Schoolboy Knows
Mon, 6 May 2019

From Gregory Bateson's *Mind and Nature*

&ldquo;Official education was telling people almost nothing of the nature of all those things on the seashores and in the redwood forests, in the deserts and the plains.  Even grown-up persons with children of their own cannot give a reasonable account fo concepts such as entropy, sacrament, syntax, number, quantity, pattern, linear relation, name, class, relevance, energy, redundancy, force, probability, parts, whole, information, tautology, homology, mass (either Newtonian or Christian), explanation, description, rule of dimensions, logical type, metaphor, topology, and so on.  What are butterflies? What are starfish?  What are beauty and ugliness?&rdquo; p. 3

Chapter II, &ldquo;Every Schoolboy Knows&rdquo;

Quoting Macauley:
&ldquo;Every schoolboy knows who imprisoned Montezuma and who strangled Atahualpa.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Those who lack all idea that it is possible to be wrong can learn nothing but know-how.&rdquo; p.28

&ldquo;It is worthwhile to attempt a tentative recognition of certain basic presuppositons which all minds must share or, conversely, to define mind by listing a number of such basic communicational characteristics:&rdquo; p.29

Section Headings:

1. Science never proves anything.

2. The map is not the territory, and the name is not the thing.

3. There is no objective experience.

4. The processes of image formation are unconscious.

5. The division of the perceived universe into parts and wholes is convenient and may be necessary, but no necessity determines how it shall be done.

6. Divergent sequences are unpredictable.

7. Convergent sequences are predictable.

8. "Nothing will come of nothing."

9. Number is different from quantity.

10. Quantity does not determine pattern.

11. There are no "monotone" values in biology.

12. Sometimes, small is beautiful.

13. Logic is a poor model of cause and effect.

14. Causality does not work backward.

15. Language commonly stresses only one side of any interaction.

16. "Stability" and "change" describe parts of our descriptions.

Bateson is another connection that I owe to The Whole Earth Catalog. I believe that I purchased and first read Steps in about 1984, then reread and made these notes in early October of 2008. Reading them now, I'm struck by how closely they seem to relate to Owen Barfield's writing.

## A Strong Antidote
Wed, May 8 2019

&ldquo;The message of the Book of Revelation is a strong antidote to times like these, now, in the past, and in the future: be strong, be prepared, and be willing to suffer, realizing that no matter how powerful and glamorous evil may seem, Jesus is the victor. We must persevere and realize that we are swept up into a cosmic battle that is much larger than our current situation but that reaches us nonetheless. We must choose sides. Don’t think that you can sit on the fence. Satan owns the fence; he will come for you and say, “You belong to me.”&rdquo;&mdash;[Msgr. Charles Pope](http://blog.adw.org/2019/05/book-revelation-sure-guide-really-going-2/)

## Replication Crisis
Thu, 9 May 2019

&ldquo;Most scientists are not corrupt but doing good science is hard, even for very intelligent and diligent people. I also suspect most researchers have inadequate education in statistics.

&ldquo;The pressure to publish, the pressure to publish conclusions that won&rsquo;t get you ostracized of your scientific community, the pressure to make whoever funds your research happy, are all corrupting influences on science.

&ldquo;If a theory makes reliable predictions, and those predictions are used by engineers, I consider it to be solid science. Otherwise, it’s most likely bunk.&rdquo;&mdash;Commenter jermo sapiens at [SlateStarCodex](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/07/5-httlpr-a-pointed-review/)


## *Imitatio Christi*
Thu, 9 May 2019

&ldquo;Ronald Knox said, of *The Imitation of Christ*, that anyone who claims to be “fond” of it is either a saint, or he is lying. This most formidable of late mediaeval spiritual guides — to call it a “devotional book” is to set out in the wrong direction — was meant as an acid bath. It strips off the skin of one’s vanity, then claws at what lies underneath. The charm in the writing lands like salt. There are no “happyface” moments, unless one counts a surprising chapter, whose number I won’t give lest some innocent try to start there. That chapter can be read as a transcription of mystical experience, along the unitive way. But I take it not as “encouragement” but as grounding and orientation, for the book is deadly serious beginning to end, and the point of it is to point the reader where the Christian must go: on a path that unavoidably includes “the dark night of the soul.”&rdquo;&mdash;[David Warren](https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2019/05/08/tough-loves/)

## Longing for Man
Mon, 13 May 2019

&ldquo;But in God there is a passionate and anguished longing for man. In God there is a tragic deficiency which is satisfied by the great gain of man’s birth in Him. The mystics taught the mystery of God’s birth in man. But there is another mystery; that of man’s birth in God. There is a summons, a call in man, for God to be born in him. This is the mystery of Christianity, the mystery of Christ, which is unknown to the Hindu mystics, to Plotinus, or to any of the abstract monistic mystics. God and man are greater than God alone. The substantial multinomial being revealed in One is greater than a One undifferentiated. Only the myth of God’s longing for man and for man’s love can bring us near to the final mystery.&rdquo;&mdash;Nikolai Berdyaev *The Meaning of the Creative Act*

## Metaphysic Mathematics
Mon, 13 May 2019

&ldquo;The crux of today's cosmological paradigm is that in order to maintain a mathematically unified theory valid for the entire universe, we must accept that 95 percent of our cosmos is furnished by completely unknown elements and forces for which we have no empirical evidence whatsoever. For a scientist to be confident of this picture requires an exceptional faith in the power of mathematical unification.&rdquo;&mdash;Bjorn Ekeberg [*Scientific American*](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/cosmology-has-some-big-problems/)

## Hospitality
Sat, 18 May 2019

**Illich**: Hospitality was a condition consequent on a good society in politics, *politaea*, and by now might be the starting point of *politaea*, of politics. But this is difficult because hospitality requires a threshold over which I can lead you — and TV, internet, newspaper, the idea of communication, abolished the walls and therefore also the friendship, the possibility of leading somebody over the door. Hospitality requires a table around which you can sit and if people get tired they can sleep. You have to belong to a subculture to say, we have a few mattresses here. It's still considered highly improper to conceive of this as the ideal moments in a day or a year. Hospitality is deeply threatened by the idea of personality, of scholastic status. I do think that if I had to choose one word to which hope can be tied it is hospitality. A practice of hospitality— recovering threshold, table, patience, listening, and from there generating seedbeds for virtue and friendship on the one hand — on the other hand radiating out for possible community, for rebirth of community.

## In-group, out-group
Sat, 18 May 2019

&ldquo;...the problem is that when we encounter opposing views in the age and context of social media, it’s not like reading them in a newspaper while sitting alone. It’s like hearing them from the opposing team while sitting with our fellow fans in a football stadium. Online, we’re connected with our communities, and we seek approval from our like-minded peers. We bond with our team by yelling at the fans of the other one. In sociology terms, we strengthen our feeling of &lsquo;in-group&rsquo; belonging by increasing our distance from and tension with the &lsquo;out-group&rsquo;&mdash;us versus them.&rdquo;&mdash;[Zeynep Tufekci](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611806/how-social-media-took-us-from-tahrir-square-to-donald-trump/)

## Creating Need
Sat, 18 May 2019

**Brown**: So Deschooling was based on the insight that the school industry teaches people, not teaches them but manipulates them, into thinking that they have certain needs that the school itself alone can satisfy?

**Illich**: That they have needs. Not all people whom I knew as a young man had needs. We were hungry but we couldn't translate the hunger into a need for food stuff. They were hungry for a tortilla, for comida, not calories. The idea that people are born with needs, that needs can be translated into rights, that these rights can be translated into entitlements, is a development of the modern world and it's reasonable, it's acceptable, it's obvious only for people who have had some of their educational needs awakened or created, then satisfied and then learned that we have less than others. Schooling, which we engage in and supposedly creates equal opportunities, has become the unique, never before attempted way of dividing the whole society into classes. Everybody knows in which level of his twelve or sixteen years of schooling he has dropped out, and in addition knows what price tag is attached to the higher schooling he has gotten.

**Brown**: So you get a precise definition of where you are in the social hierarchy by how much schooling your had or how much schooling you don't have, so you didn't know you needed fourteen years and a postgraduate degree or to get out of high school depending upon where you lived.

**Illich**: It's a history of degrading the majority of people.

**Brown**: So you take somebody who's poor and you modernize the poverty by not only having a person that doesn't have a lot of material goods but now lacks the mental self-confidence that his father or grandfather had before that.

**Illich**: And I can create a world for him in which he needs constantly something which--at that time I searched for a word I didn't findd, context sensitive help. You know, when you are in front of a computer and when you are in that program and put in Word Perfect it tells you what help you need at that point at which you are. This is instructions for use. This is incorporation of teaching into the object with which you encounter at its high point. We have created a world in which people constantly are grateful if they are taken by the hand to know how to use a knife or to use the coffee maker or how to go on from here in text composing.

&mdash;Ivan Illich [Interview with Jerry Brown](http://www.wtp.org/archive/transcripts/ivan_illich_jerry.html)

## Objectify
Sat, 18 May 2019

**Illich**: ...Inevitably modern technology has polarized society. It has polluted the environment. It has disabled very simple native abilities and made them dependent on objects.

**Brown**: Like an automobile.

**Illich**: An automobile which cuts out the use value from your feet. Like an automobile which makes the world inaccessible when actually that means in Latin using your feet to get somewhere. The automobile makes it unthinkable. I recently had the question, "You're a liar!" when I said to somebody I walked down the spine of the Andes. Every Spaniard in the 16th, 17th century did that. The idea that somebody could just walk! He can jog perhaps in the morning but he can't walk anywhere! The world has become inaccessible because we drive there.

**Brown**: So the objects, like a car or even like a school, change who we are.

**Illich**: Who you are and even more deeply they change the way your senses work. Traditionally the gaze was conceived as a way of fingering, of touching. The old Greeks spoke about looking as a way of sending out my *psychopodia* [?], my soul's limbs, to touch your face and establish a relationship between the two of us which is this relationship, and this relationship was called vision. Then, after Galileo at the time of Kepler, the idea developed that the eyes are receptors into which light brings something from the outside, keeping you separate from me even when I look at you. Even if I gaze at you. Even if I enjoy your face. People began to conceive of their eyes as some kind of camera obscura. In our age people conceive of their eyes and actually use them as if they were part of a machinery. They speak about interface. Anybody who says to me, I want to have an interface with you, I say please go somewhere else, to a toilet or wherever you want, to a mirror. Anybody who says, I want to communicate with you, I say can't you talk? Can't you speak? Can't you recognize that there's a deep otherness between me and you, so deep that it would be offensive for me to be programmed in the same way you are.

&mdash;Ivan Illich [Interview with Jerry Brown](http://www.wtp.org/archive/transcripts/ivan_illich_jerry.html)

## Somebody Gets It
Mon, 20 May 2019

“I have an idea that some men are born out of their due place. Accident has cast them amid strangers in their birthplace, and the leafy lanes they have known from childhood or the populous streets in which they have played, remain but a place of passage. they may spend their whole lives aliens among their kindred and remain aloof among the only scenes they have ever known. Perhaps it is this sense of strangeness that sends men far and wide in the search for something permanent, to which they may attach themselves. Perhaps some deep-rooted atavism urges the wanderer back to lands which his ancestors left in the dim beginnings of history. Sometimes a man hits upon a place to which he mysteriously feels that he belongs. Here is the home he sought, and he will settle amid scenes that he has never seen before, among men he has never known, as though they were familiar to him from his birth. Here at last he finds rest.”&mdash; W. Somerset Maugham, *The Moon and Sixpence* 1919

## Observations
Mon, 20 May 2019

&ldquo;The Church is not in crisis, as Cardinal Sarah was saying the other day. We are in crisis. The Devil wants us to think that God has abandoned His Church. He hasn’t. In fact, He can’t, if I may add my theological understanding of the matter. I like to quote Joan of Arc: “About Jesus Christ and the Church, I simply know they’re just one thing, and we shouldn’t complicate the matter.” It is only when we redefine the Church, to be something it is not, that complications arise.&rdquo;&mdash;[David Warren](https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2019/05/20/depends-what-you-mean-by-is/)

## Going Through the Motions
Mon, 20 May 2019

&ldquo;Even going through the motions has value, when the motions are in service to a cause that is divine. Inspiration is anyway for special occasions. The Mass is valid, when we go through the motions; it was actually designed to be hard to invalidate. We needn’t bother our little heads with whether the priest is worthy. That is his business. We need only ask if we are in any way adequate to receive the Host, for the consequences of my not being worthy do not fall upon anyone else, except tangentially; and neither can my guilt be transferred to my neighbour.&rdquo;&mdash;[David Warren](https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2019/05/20/depends-what-you-mean-by-is/)

## Still Hated After All These Years
Thu, 23 May 2019

&ldquo;What greater proof of his divinity could there be than the fact that he is still resisted, even hated, after 2,000 years? Nobody hates Julius Caesar anymore; it’s pretty hard even to hate Attila the Hun, who left a lot of hard feelings in his day. But the world still hates Christ and his Church.&rdquo;&mdash;Joseph Sobran, *Subtracting Christianity: Essays on American Culture and Society*

## So Few, So Many
Thu, 23 May 2019

&ldquo;When we jumped into Sicily, the units became separated, and I couldn’t find anyone. Eventually I stumbled across two colonels, a major, three captains, two lieutenants, and one rifleman, and we secured the bridge. Never in the history of war have so few been led by so many.&rdquo;&mdash;General James Gavin, quoted in Jerry Pournelle and Larry Niven *Oath of Fealty*

## Rebirth
Thu, 23 May 2019

&ldquo;In his book The Everlasting Man, G. K. Chesterton describes the power of orthodoxy to renew itself, in a chapter titled “Five Deaths of the Faith.” Christianity, he tells us, was never really reborn, because it never really died. The cultures it lived in died, so Christianity was rediscovered five times in the history of the West, as one cultural epoch was superseded by another. This happened after the fall of Rome, then in the twelfth century at the end of the feudal era, again when the medieval synthesis gave way to the secular energies of the Renaissance, again when the Renaissance fell to the new rationalism of the Enlightenment, and yet again as Enlightenment values have begun to dissolve with the arrival of our postindustrial age.&rdquo;&mdash;G. K. Chesterton, *The Everlasting Man*, 250 quoted in Robert Inchausti, *Subversive Orthodoxy*, 16

## Eckhart
Thu, 23 May 2019

&ldquo;Eckhart had neither the desire to take aught away from the content of Christianity, nor the wish to add anything to it; but he desired to bring forward this content anew in his own way. It forms no part of the spiritual needs of a personality such as he was to set up new truths of this or the other kind in the place of old ones. Such a personality has grown completely intertwined with the content which it has received from tradition; but it craves to give to this content a new form, a new life.&rdquo;&mdash;Rudolf Steiner, *Mystics of the Renaissance*

## No Matter
Sat, 25 May 2019

&ldquo;But there is one thing that is infinitely more absurd and unpractical than burning a man for his philosophy. This is the habit of saying that his philosophy does not matter, and this is done universally in the twentieth century, in the decadence of the great revolutionary period.&rdquo;&mdash;G.K. Chesterton, *Heretics*

## Smart Dogs

## Two Ways
Sat, 25 May 2019

&ldquo;There are but two ways of forming an opinion in science. One is the scientific method; the other, the scholastic. One can judge from experiement, or one can blindly accept authority. To the scientific mind, experimental proof is all-important, and theory is merely a convenience in description, to be junked when it no lo0nger fits. To the academic mind, authority is everything, and facts are junked when they do not fit theory laid down by authority.&rdquo;&mdash;Robert A. Heinlein, *Life-Line*

Tue, 04 Jun 2019

&ldquo;The soul … has grown aware of her obligations and observed that life is short (Job 14:5), the path leading to eternal life constricted (Mt. 7:14), the just one scarcely saved (1 Pet. 4:18), the things of the world vain and deceitful (Eccles. 1:2), that all comes to an end and fails like falling water (2 Sam. 14:14), and that the time is uncertain, the accounting strict, perdition very easy, and salvation very difficult.&rdquo;&mdash;St. John of the Cross, *Spiritual Canticle*

## Hospitality
Thu, 06 Jun 2019

&ldquo;Learned and leisurely hospitality is the only antidote to the stance of deadly cleverness that is acquired in the professional pursuit of objectively secured knowledge.

## Severe Logic
Sat, 08 Jun 2019

“At the same time that we were studying the Greek Tragic Poets, he (Bowyer, Head Master of the Grammar School, Christ’s Hospital) made us read Shakespeare and Milton as lessons: and they were the lessons, too, which required most time and trouble to bring up so as to escape his censure. I learnt from him, that Poetry, even that of the loftiest and, seemingly, that of the wildest odes, had a logic of its own, as severe as that of science; and more difficult, because more subtle, more complex, and dependent upon more, and more fugitive, causes.”&mdash;S. T. Coleridge, *Biographia Literaria*

## Spritual, Not Religious
Tue, 11 Jun 2019

&ldquo;A familiar A.A. clich&#233; describes the fellowship&rsquo;s program as &ldquo;spiritual rather than religious,&rdquo; and members of Alcoholics Anonymous tend to enforce this distinction vigorously upon both those who comment on their program and themselves at A.A. meetings. This deep and real concern over its image as &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; bears vivid witness to A.A.&rsquo;s authentic modernity, especially as a religious phenomenon. The mistrust of religious claims that matured in the Enlightenment has so deepened and spread that, in the twentieth centure, secularization has become the hallmark of modernity. Over those same two centuries between the Enlightenment and the present, however, the reaction of Romanticism against Enlightenment rationalism has also become culturally internalized and effectively stylized. Thus, in yet another paradox, moderns readily accept &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; even as they resolutely reject &ldquo;belief&rdquo; as a wellspring of personal action, at least so long as it does not intrude upon the autonomy of others.&rdquo;&mdash;Ernie Kurtz, *Not God*

## Lower Bodies, Higher Bodies
Sun, 16 Jun 2019

&ldquo;Now, just as there is a difference between higher and lower intellectual substances, so also is there such a difference between corporeal substances. But intellectual substances are ruled by the higher ones, since the disposition of divine providence descends proportionally to the lowest, as we have said already. Therefore, on a like basis, the lower bodies are ordered through the higher ones.&rdquo;&mdash;St. Thomas Aquinas, *Summa Contra Gentiles* Book 3

## Parmenides
Tue, 18 Jun 2019

&ldquo;What I am saying is this: There is internal evidence in at least one of my novels that another reality, an unchanging one, exactly as Parmenides and Plato suspected, underlies the visible phenomenal world of change, and somehow, in some way, perhaps to our surprise, we can cut through to it. Or rather, a mysterious Spirit can put us in touch with it, if it wishes us to see this permanent other landscape. Time passes, thousands of years pass, but at the same instant that we see this contemporary world, the ancient world, the world of the Bible, is concealed beneath it, still there and still real. Eternally so.&rdquo;&mdash;Philip K. Dick [How to Build a Universe That Doesn’t Fall Apart Two Days Later](https://urbigenous.net/library/how_to_build.html)

## The Resolution of Grief
Tue, 18 Jun 2019

&ldquo;A very deep form of grief is grieving over our own intuitive knowledge of our own value which we have not paid proper attention to, and we have not properly learned to use in the world for our own sake, or for the sake of others. It&rsquo;s as though the grief is about a beautiful treasure that was within our reach all the time and yet we didn&rsquo;t stretch out and use this treasure and enjoy it in the way it should be used and enjoyed.&rdquo;&mdash;William Arkle *The Great Gift*

## An Exception
Fri, 21 Jun 2019

"Man is an exception, whatever else he is. If he is not the image of God, then he is a disease of the dust. If it is not true that a divine being fell, then we can only say that one of the animals went entirely off his head."&mdash;G.K. Chesterton: *All Things Considered*

## Saving Humanity
Sat, 29 Jun 2019

&ldquo;The urge to save humanity is almost always only a false-face for the urge to rule it. Power is what all messiahs really seek: not the chance to serve. This is true even of the pious brethren who carry the gospel to foreign parts.&rdquo;&mdash;H.L. Mencken

## Respect
Sat, 29 Jun 2019

&ldquo;Respect, I note, was once conferred upon the dutiful. It was not until recently that a “theory” was hatched — a bastardization of ancient Christian teaching — that compelled us to show respect to all, and civility even to the uncivil. This was an important abridgement of our freedom: to decide, for ourselves, whom to love, admire, ignore, fear, detest, &c. It interferes with our duty to make sound judgements, thus dehumanizing us.&rdquo;&mdash;[David Warren](https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2019/06/26/aside-on-law-order/)

## Barlow&rsquo;s 25
Mon, 1 Jul 2019

John Perry Barlow's 25 Principles of Adult Behavior:

1. Be patient. No matter what.

2. Don’t badmouth: Assign responsibility, not blame. Say nothing of another you wouldn’t say to him.

3. Never assume the motives of others are, to them, less noble than yours are to you.

4. Expand your sense of the possible.

5. Don’t trouble yourself with matters you truly cannot change.

6. Expect no more of anyone than you can deliver yourself.

7. Tolerate ambiguity.

8. Laugh at yourself frequently.

9. Concern yourself with what is right rather than who is right.

10. Never forget that, no matter how certain, you might be wrong.

11. Give up blood sports.

12. Remember that your life belongs to others as well. Don’t risk it frivolously.

13. Never lie to anyone for any reason. (Lies of omission are sometimes exempt.)

14. Learn the needs of those around you and respect them.

15. Avoid the pursuit of happiness. Seek to define your mission and pursue that.

16. Reduce your use of the first personal pronoun.

17. Praise at least as often as you disparage.

18. Admit your errors freely and soon.

19. Become less suspicious of joy.

20. Understand humility.

21. Remember that love forgives everything.

22. Foster dignity.

23. Live memorably.

24. Love yourself.

25. Endure.

## Analog Future
Mon, 1 Jul 2019

&ldquo;Nature uses digital coding for the storage, replication, recombination, and error correction of sequences of nucleotides, but relies on analog coding and analog computing for intelligence and control. No programming, no code. To those seeking true intelligence, autonomy, and control among machines, the domain of analog computing, not digital computing, is the place to look.&rdquo;&mdash;[George Dyson](https://www.edge.org/conversation/george_dyson-childhoods-end)

## Potatoes
Tue, 2 Jul 2019

&ldquo;What is this mind of ours; what are these atoms with consciousness? Last week&rsquo;s potatoes!&rdquo;&mdash;Richard Feynman

Assuming, of course that there is a one-to-one exclusive relationship between mind/consciousness and brain, which seems to me to be extremely complex. There's clearly a relationship, but is it exclusive? Without a brain&mdash;divorced from living matter&mdash;is there some element of mind or even consciousness? Soul? Spirit? Arr, that's the question! Or perhaps a step on the way to the question...

## The Relation of Christians to the World
Sat, 6 Jul 2019

&ldquo;To sum up all in one word--what the soul is in the body, that are Christians in the world. The soul is dispersed through all the members of the body, and Christians are scattered through all the cities of the world. The soul dwells in the body, yet is not of the body; and Christians dwell in the world, yet are not of the world. The invisible soul is guarded by the visible body, and Christians are known indeed to be in the world, but their godliness remains invisible. The flesh hates the soul, and wars against it, though itself suffering no injury, because it is prevented from enjoying pleasures; the world also hates the Christians, though in nowise injured, because they abjure pleasures. The soul loves the flesh that hates it, and [loves also] the members; Christians likewise love those that hate them. The soul is imprisoned in the body, yet preserves that very body; and Christians are confined in the world as in a prison, and yet they are the preservers of the world. The immortal soul dwells in a mortal tabernacle; and Christians dwell as sojourners in corruptible [bodies], looking for an incorruptible dwelling in the heavens. The soul, when but ill-provided with food and drink, becomes better; in like manner, the Christians, though subjected day by day to punishment, increase the more in number. God has assigned them this illustrious position, which it were unlawful for them to forsake.&rdquo;&mdash;Diagnetus, *[The Epistle of Mathetes to Diognetus](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/diognetus-roberts.html)*

## Cognitive Liberty
Mon, 8 Jul 2019

The aim of the chapter is to draw attention to a fundamental right that is neglected in the law but that is highly relevant for neuroethics: cognitive liberty or freedom of thought. Although an internationally accepted human right, it has not gained practical legal importance. However, any regulation of neurotechnologies has to be evaluated in its light. As the right is unfamiliar to policy makers and even to many lawyers and legal scholars, its historical development and the main arguments for its recognition are sketched. Furthermore, some suggestions for its interpretation, scope, and contours are forwarded and remaining open questions identified. According to international human rights law, the right is of absolute nature so that interferences cannot be justified for interests of the common good or paternalistic reasons. Whether this strict prohibition of intervening into other persons’ minds can and should be sustained even in light of putative pressing public interests and various neuroethical considerations is one of the novel questions neuroscience poses for the law.&mdash;Christoph Bublitz, Faculty of Law, University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany *[Cognitive Liberty or the International Human Right to Freedom of Thought](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-007-4707-4_166)*

## Cognitive Liberty Redux
Mon, 8 Jul 2019

“Thou canst not touch the freedom of my mind.” (Milton, *Comus*)

“Everyone has the right to freedom to hold opinions without interference.” (United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights)

“Men fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth &mdash more than ruin &mdash; more even than death.... Thought is subversive and revolutionary, destructive and terrible, thought is merciless to privilege, established institutions, and comfortable habit. Thought looks into the pit of hell and is not afraid. Thought is great and swift and free, the light of the world, and the chief glory of man.” (Bertrand Russell)

## Reading with a Pencil
Mon, 8 Jul 2019

&ldquo;The intellectual is, quite simply, a human being who has a pencil in his or her hand when reading a book.&rdquo;—George Steiner

&ldquo;There’s a way of reading that is like writing. You feel in collaboration… You have a pen in your hand, you’re going along in a way that’s, like, half creating it as you go. And you’re also strip-mining it for anything you can use… you’re sifting for what could be gold.&rdquo;—Patricia Lockwood

“Every piece of art I’ve ever made was because I saw bad and could do better, or saw great and needed to catch up.”&mdash;John T. Unger

“Full ownership of a book only comes when you have made it a part of yourself, and the best way to make yourself a part of it — which comes to the same thing — is by writing in it. Why is marking a book indispensable to reading it? First, it keeps you awake — not merely conscious, but wide awake. Second, reading, if it is active, is thinking, and thinking tends to express itself in words, spoken or written. The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks. Third, writing your reactions down helps you to remember the thoughts of the author. Reading a book should be a conversation between you and the author….Marking a book is literally an expression of your differences or your agreements…It is the highest respect you can pay him..”&mdash;Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren , *How To Read A Book*

## Indifferent
Tue, 9 Jul 2019

&ldquo;I don't know of any teaching more self-centered and further from the facts than Marxism. Ordinarily, people are anxious to test their theories in practice, to learn from experience. But those who wield power are so anxious to establish the myth of their own infallibility that they turn their backs on truth as  squarely as they can. Politics mean nothing to me. I don't like people who are indifferent to the truth.&rdquo;&mdash;Boris Pasternak, *Doctor Zhivago*

## Printing
Wed, 10 Jul 2019

"Printing diffused true knowledge, but it also diffused (and on a far greater scale) false knowledge and unproved irrational affirmation."&mdash;Hilaire Belloc, *The Crisis of Our Civilization*

## Persecution
Wed, 10 Jul 2019

"But if I be asked what sign we may look for to show that the advance of the Faith is at hand, I would answer by a word the modern world has forgotten: Persecution. When that shall be at work it will be morning."&ndash;Hilaire Belloc, *Survivals and New Arrivals*


## Making Money vs Spending Money
Wed, 10 Jul 2019

“Big money isn’t hard to come by. All it costs is a lifetime of devotion. But no ballerina ever works harder. Captain, that’s not your style; you don’t want to make money, you simply want to spend money.”

“Correct, sir! So I can’t see why you would want to take Mike’s wealth away from him.”
“Because great wealth is a curse—unless you enjoy money-making for its own sake. Even then it has serious drawbacks.”

“Oh, piffle! Jubal, you talk like a harem guard trying to sell a whole man on the advantages of being a eunuch.”

“Possibly,” agreed Jubal. “The mind’s ability to rationalize its own shortcomings is unlimited; I am no exception. Since I, like yourself, sir, have no interest in money other than to spend it, it is impossible for me to get rich. Conversely, there has never been any danger that I would fail to scrounge the modest amount needed to feed my vices, since anyone with the savvy not to draw to a small pair can do that. But great wealth?....Captain, you don’t know what an Old Man of the Sea great wealth is. Its owner is beset on every side, like beggars in Bombay, each demanding that he invest or give away part of his wealth. He becomes suspicious—honest friendship is rarely offered him; those who could have been friends are too fastidious to be jostled by beggars, too proud to risk being mistaken for one.

“Worse yet, his family is always in danger. Captain, have your daughters ever been threatened with kidnapping?”

“What? Good Lord, no!”

“If you possessed the wealth Mike had thrust on him, you would have those girls guarded night and day—still you would not rest, because you would never be sure of the guards. Look at the last hundred or so kidnappings and note how many involved a trusted employee . . . and how few victims escaped alive. Is there anything money can buy which is worth having your daughters’ necks in a noose?”

Van Tromp looked thoughtful. “I’ll keep my mortgaged house, Jubal.”

“Amen. I want to live my own life, sleep in my own bed—and not be bothered!”&mdash;Robert A. Heinlein, *Stranger in a Strange Land*

## Petty Alienation
Wed, 10 Jul 2019

“Free-floating, petty gripes are a result of Miserabilism as a world view, the idea that viewing Western Civ as a hellish, gruesome burden destined to collapse of its sins and conceits is the only possible worldview for a Serious Person. Hence the more fault you find, the deeper you are. It comes from being grounded in nothing but the shallow soil of the present, with no sense of history except for a series of pre-approved narratives intended to culminate in an argument against the recent past, which was bad because it prevented the wonderful possible Tomorrow from happening Today. It’s a recipe for life-long alienation.”&mdash;[James Lileks](http://lileks.com/bleats/archive/19/0719/070919.html)

## Names
Fri, 12 Jul 2019

“The sage Confucius was once asked what he would do if he was a governor. He said he would “rectify the names” to make words correspond to reality. He understood what General Semantics teaches; if your linguistic map is sufficiently confused, you will misunderstand the territory. And be readily outmaneuvered by those who are less confused.”&mdash;[Eric S. Raymond](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8415)

esr goes on to make interesting and important comments about the currently hot Richard Epstein scandal and its larger context, seriously worth reading and thinking about.

I'm posting it here, however, to note the map/territory statement, which Gregory Bateson speaks about at length in *Steps to an Ecology of Mind* (1972) and/or *Mind and Nature* (1979), Bateson being an “English anthropologist, social scientist, linguist, visual anthropologist, semiotician, and cyberneticist” per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Bateson) and a founding participant, with his wife Margaret Mead, in the Macy Conferences. Stewart Brand introduced me to his work via the WEC, and it's been at least somewhat influential in my muddled thinking.

And now, the question is how does this form of General Semantics fit in with (or survive?) Barfield's philological analysis of how consciousness evolved and relates to the “unrepresented” as well as the “appearances”.

## Principles and Edge Cases
Sat, 13 Jul 2019

Principles that we suspend during difficult times aren’t really principles. Principles really count when they’re difficult to maintain.

That’s not the same thing, though, as refusing to consider the edge cases.

“Free speech,” is a fine principle, one to live by. But shouting “fire” in a crowded movie theater isn’t allowed, for good reason.

The edge cases are always subject to endless debate. There are no easy bright lines. It’s tempting, then, to never consider the edge cases. A rule’s a rule.

But principles without judgment aren’t the easy path they seem to be. Because without our judgment on the edge cases, we’ve given up responsibility. It’s no longer our decision if we’re not making a decision.

The hard work involves willingly being on the hook for making a tough call.

## Clowns
Sun, 14 Jul 2019

Isn't it rich?<br/>
Are we a pair?<br/>
Me here at last on the ground,</br>
You in mid-air.<br/>
Where are the clowns?

Isn't it bliss?

Don't you approve?

One who keeps tearing around,

One who can't move...

Where are the clowns?

There ought to be clowns.


Just when I'd stopped opening doors,

Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours.

Making my entrance again with my usual flair

Sure of my lines...

No one is there.


Don't you love farce?

My fault, I fear.

I thought that you'd want what I want...

Sorry, my dear!

But where are the clowns

Send in the clowns

Don't bother, they're here.


Isn't it rich?

Isn't it queer?

Losing my timing this late in my career.

But where are the clowns?

There ought to be clowns...

Well, maybe next year.

Stephen Sondheim, *A Little Night Music* 1973

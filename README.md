This is where I keep my fieldstones - you know about fieldstones, don't you? Gerry Weinberg's writing idea?

I used to use a blog, when I took that down to move it, I dumped them to Markdown by year. Those older files may get edited some, but any new additions go to the current year's file.

Commit messages are useless because I use a simple script to update - one day I may change that, but virtually any commit will be the last one or two added fieldstones. Live with it.

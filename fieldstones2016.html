<h2 id="september-10-2001">September 10, 2001</h2>
<p>Sun, 11 Sep 2016 00:58:53</p>
<p>It’s a stretch to remember what concerned me fifteen years ago, on September 10, 2001.</p>
<p>William Butler Yeats wrote <em>Easter, 1916</em> in part describing Easter Sunday, April 23, 1916, the day before the Easter Rising, and how after Easter Monday:</p>
<p>  He, too, has resigned his part</br>   In the casual comedy;</br>   He, too, has been changed in his turn,</br>   Transformed utterly:</br>   A terrible beauty is born.</br></p>
<p>And W. H. Auden, in <em>September 1, 1939</em> covered the same ground as Germany poised to invade Poland:</p>
<p>  Uncertain and afraid</br>   As the clever hopes expire</br>   Of a low dishonest decade:</br>   Waves of anger and fear</br>   Circulate over the bright</br>   And darkened lands of the earth,</br>   Obsessing our private lives;</br>   The unmentionable odour of death.</br></p>
<p>I can’t help noticing a significant difference that we face today, however.</p>
<p>The Irish Republic was established three years after the Rising, and WWII had come to an end in just under six years after the invasion of Poland, long, terrible years that they were in both cases, but the still the denouement was achieved.</p>
<p>And here we are, fifteen years later.</p>
<p>I had no idea. Did you?</p>
<p>Have you found the poem describing September 10, 2001? Is it too soon?</p>

<p>Thu, 22 Sep 2016 20:46:41</p>
<p>Why, indeed? When Facebook, Twitter and whatever other social media silos exist out there, where Everybody is following Everybody else, why write something new to add to something as old-school, so Last Year or Last Decade as a blog, where arguably nobody will see it?</p>
<p>Well, trust me, I’ve tried to share “socially”, at least on FB. I resisted joining that Place where Youngsters Talk Past Each Other for a while. My tipping point came sometime in the spring of 2012 while I was visiting Maryland to stay with my ailing Father. My first night there, my baby sister (who lived next door to him) dropped in and said, “Congratulations!” I was grateful for the kind words, but didn’t know why I was to be congratulated. “Because Caitlyn is having another baby—you’re going to be a Great-Grandpa again!” It turns out that any family news is now shared on Facebook and nowhere else. OK, I may be a Canuck by choice, but I’m not going to be Canute, ordering the tides to cease. I joined Facebook and tried to play the game.</p>
<p>I’ve been as loyal a FB’er as an over-the-hill not-very-leftist Old Fart could, sharing family pictures, commenting kindly (most of the time) on others’ family pictures, and sharing silly pictures with humorous (if sometimes a bit sharp) “memes” and links to interesting articles about this and that. For the most part, I’ve practiced “Stifle yerself, Edith!” as I learned to do during my career as a Federal Consultant, surrounded by Feds, Social Workers and Academics who either tolerated my trogdolitism or blithely assumed that I was One Of Them politically or ideologically.</p>
<p>This Federal Election Cycle, I’ve practiced and encouraged others to practice (with little effect) a strict policy of No Digs At Candidates—If You Must Talk Politics, Discuss What You’re For, Not Who You’re Repelled By. It’s been a struggle, but rewarding. I haven’t “unliked” anyone, although I’ve had to “unfollow” a few to not be constantly upset.</p>
<p>Anyway, there are topics of interest to Old Farts other than Federal Politics, although this close to the Imperial Capital that seems hard to imagine. Every now and then I’d wax so fulsomely on some topic that the dreaded “see more” would appear with most of the thought swallowed by the FB interface (don’t get me started on the FB interface, though). All evidence is that none of those hidden words were ever seen or heard from again. I’ve been tempted to close a longer, thoughtful post with something bizarre, like a “farewell, cruel world” note just to see whether anyone at all read it, but instead I’ve decided to just hide it over here, in Consultingsmiths limbo. Cheers!</p>

<p>David Warren’s <a href="http://www.davidwarrenonline.com/" target="_blank">“Essays in Idleness”</a> blog is usually at least amusing or interesting, and not uncommonly thought provoking. I don’t know him personally, but I have the feeling that he’d be somewhat uncomfortable being described as “profound”, so I won’t do so. Today, he’s at least worth quoting: “A lot of time has been wasted by busybodied fools arguing that someone other than Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare; that someone other than Homer wrote Homer. (“Another poet of that generation who happened to have the same name.”) The time would be better spent reading such authors. The same is true, generally, of the Church Fathers: better to read them in their breadth, and not with a view to pursuing small vexatious points—inevitably to factional ends."

<p>Well, now I know that at least one person other than Me, Myself and I drop in here…I was asked to moderate the first spam comment in literally years this morning. Something about “arena oxides” and how much the princess, their friend, was edified by the deep thinking and perceptive helping nature that I displayed in a post a few days ago, accompanied by a gibberish email address and several links that even I am too timid to follow. I guess I should thank Google for the exposure.</p>

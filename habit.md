# The Force of Habit

## Owen Barfield

This is the third of the three lectures I have been so kindly invited to give in Vancouver. I believe the position is that some people are enjoying the high privilege of sitting through all three of them, while others are having to make do with two or even only one of the three. I don’t often come to Vancouver—not because I don’t want to, but because I happen to live about 6,000 miles away—and perhaps for that reason, when I came to prepare them, I couldn’t help thinking of the whole venture as a single project, and of the three lectures, even though not all given in the same place, as in come sense forming a single whole. I hope that unity is nevertheless a tri-unity—I have tried to make it so—and that any single one of the lectures has made, or will make some sense taken by itself. I shall be obliged, in this lecture, to refer at times to matters dealt with in the other two preceding ones, but I will try, with the help of a little unashamed repetition, to do so clearly and fully enough to meet at least the minimum requirements of those who did not hear them.

One of the points I tried to make, at some length, in the first lecture, which concerned the evolution of consciousness, was this: that it is a mistake—although it is a mistake that we nearly all make all the time, and we all make nearly all the time—to imagine that inward and immaterial component of the totality we call “the world” as being a sort of something located and confined inside our heads.

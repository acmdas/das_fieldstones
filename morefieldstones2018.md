## Hiding from the mission
Sun, 07 Jan 2018

We do this in two ways:
The first is refusing to be clear and precise about what the mission is. Avoiding specifics about what we hope to accomplish and for whom. Being vague about success and (thus about failure).

After all, if no one knows exactly what the mission is, it's hard feel like a failure if it doesn't succeed.

The second is even more insidious. We degrade the urgency of the mission. We become diffuse. We get distracted. Anything to avoid planting a stake and saying, "I made this."

It's possible to spend 7 hours and 52 minutes out of an eight-hour day in doing nothing but hiding from the mission. And it's exhausting.

## He is Inescapable
Wed, 10 Jan 2018

&ldquo;Because God is not a finite object over against you as a subject, you cannot simply turn away towards &lsquo;something else.&rdquo;; He is the ground and end of all desire and knowledge as such, the Good in itself. You cannot choose or not choose God the way you would choose or not choose a cup of coffee. You desire anything because of your original desire for God as the transcendental Good and Beautiful; you know anything because of your original intellectual appetite for God as the transcendental Truth as such. Even in desiring to flee God, you are desiring God as the &lsquo;good end&rdquo; you seek in godlessness. He is inescapable because all being, goodness, unity, truth, and beauty simply are God in their transcendent truth, and because a rational nature is nothing but an infinite dynamic orientation towards that transcendent end. The natural will, as Maximus says, can will only God. Don&rsquo;t think of God as a candidate in a political race, whom you could simply reject and be done with; he is the original and final act of your every discrete act of desire. And, in the ages, since God is all and there is literally nothing beyond him, the natural will is always seeking its natural supernatural end. Simply said, God is not an object of desire; he is the end that makes desire.&rdquo;&mdash;<a href="https://afkimel.wordpress.com/essential-readings-on-universalism/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">David Bentley Hart</a>

## Being Christian
Wed, 10 Jan 2018

"It is almost universally assumed today that becoming a Christian means in essence the adoption of a new set of beliefs or the initiation of a new mode of behaviour. A Christian would be defined as one who 'believes in Christ' or 'worships Christ' or 'tries to follow Christ's teaching.' Now it is far from my purpose to belittle either Christian dogma or Christian ethics. Nevertheless, it must be pointed out that to define the essence of Christianity in terms of belief or of practice involves the neglect of two principles that are fundamental to all sound theology. The former of these is that the act of God precedes and is presupposed by the acts of man: 'Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us'; 'Ye have come to know God, <em>or rather to be known of God</em>.' The second is that what a being <em>is</em> precedes what it <em>does</em>; our actions are a consequence of what we are <em>operari sequitur esse</em>. It will follow from this that the Christian should be defined not in terms of what he himself does, but of what God has made him to be. Being a Christian is an ontological fact, resulting from an act of God."&mdash;E. L. Mascall, <em>Christ, the Christian, and the Church</em> p.77

## Meditation for January 15
Mon, 15 Jan 2018

I will relax and not get tense. I will have no fear, because everything will work out in the end. I will learn soul-balance and poise in a vacillating, changing world. I will claim God's power and use it because if I do not use it, it will be withdrawn. As long as I get back to God and replenish my strength after each task, no work can be too much. 
Prayer for the Day
I pray that I may relax and that God's strength will be given to me. I pray that I may subject my will to God's will and be free from all tenseness.
From the original AA Meditation book, <em>Twenty-Four Hours a Day</em>, by Richmond Walker

## Okay?
Sun, 21 Jan 2018

"Everything will be okay in the end. If it's not okay, it's not the end"&mdash;John Lennon, or maybe Paulo Coelho, or maybe someone else.

## The Cost of Discipleship
Tue, 23 Jan 2018

"What did Jesus want to say to us? What does he want from us today? How does he help us to be faithful Christians today? It is not ultimately important to us what this or that church leader wants. Rather, we want to know what Jesus wants. When we go to hear a sermon, his own word is what we want to hear. This matters to us not only for our own sakes, but also for all those who have become estranged from the church and its message. It is also our opinion that if Jesus himself and Jesus alone with his word were among us in our preaching, then quite a different set of people would hear the word and quite a different set of people would again turn away from it."&mdash;Dietrich Bonhoeffer, <em>The Cost of Discipleship</em>

## Democracy of the Dead
Thu, 25 Jan 2018

&ldquo;Tradition means giving a vote to most obscure of all classes, our ancestors. It is the democracy of the dead.&rdquo;&mdash;G. K. Chesterton, <em>Orthodoxy</em>, Chapter 4.

## A Short Story
Thu, 25 Jan 2018

"A man, walking through the forest saw a fox that had lost its legs, and wondered how it lived. Then he saw a tiger come up with game in its mouth. The tiger ate its fill and left the rest of the meat for the fox. The next day God fed the fox by means of the same tiger.
"The man began to wonder at God&rsquo;s greatness and said to himself, 'I too shall just rest in a corner with full trust in the Lord and He will provide me with all I need.'
"He did this for many days, but nothing happened, and he was almost at death&rsquo;s door when he heard a voice say, 'O you who are in the path of error, open your eyes to the truth! Stop imitating the disabled fox and follow the example of the tiger'&rdquo;&mdash;Ernie Kurtz

## Gospel Demands
Sun, 28 Jan 2018

&ldquo;If the gospel demands that we renounce this world . . . , then the simple thing to do is: do it&rdquo;&mdash;SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard, <em>Journals</em>

## Instructions For Wayfarers
Tue, 30 Jan 2018

*They will declare: Every journey has been taken.

You shall respond: I have not been to see myself.

They will insist: Everything has been spoken.

You shall reply: I have not had my say.

They will tell you: Everything has been done.

You shall reply: My way is not complete.

You are warned: Any way is long, any way is hard.

Fear not. You are the gate&mdash;you, the gatekeeper.

And you shall go through and on . . .*&mdash;Alexandros Evangelou Xenopouloudakis

## Politics
Thu, 01 Feb 2018

&ldquo;A state cannot be constituted from any chance body of persons, or in any chance period of time. Most of the states which have admitted persons of another stock, either at the time of their foundation or later, have been troubled by sedition.&rdquo;&mdash;Aristotle, *Politics*

## Falling Out
Thu, 01 Feb 2018

&ldquo;The hard part isn't coming up with a new idea.
The hard part is falling out of love with the old idea.
That's why editing work is so difficult. In order to make the new thing, to make the old thing better, you need to destroy it first.
Situation switching, acting as if, loving the idea enough to sketch it out and then caring enough to stop loving it... that's where the tension often lies.&rdquo;&mdash;<a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2018/02/falling-out.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Seth Godin</a>

## The Exterminator
Thu, 01 Feb 2018

"If you've got an infestation of rats, you call the guy to come in," she says.
"You don't care if his crack's showing. You don't care if he's swearing.
"You don't care if he's got tobacco-stained teeth. You want the rats taken out."&mdash;from <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42628577" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BBC's take</a> on why Michigan flipped for Trump in 2016.

## Little Things
Thu, 08 Feb 2018

<em>Quod minimum, minimum est,
Sed in minimo fidelem esse,
magnum est.</em>
What is a little thing, is (just) a little thing,
But to be faithful in a little thing,
is a great thing.&mdash;St. Thomas Aquinas <em>De Doctrina Christiana</em>, IV,35

## Incompatibility
Mon, 12 Feb 2018

"IF Americans can be divorced for 'incompatibility of temper,' I cannot conceive why they are not all divorced. I have known many happy marriages, but never a compatible one. The whole aim of marriage is to fight through and survive the instant when incompatibility becomes unquestionable. For a man and a woman, as such, are incompatible."&mdash;G.K. Chesterton: <em>What's Wrong with the World</em>.

## Critics
Thu, 15 Feb 2018 14:33:23

A "critic" is a person who creates nothing and thereby feels qualified to judge the work of creative people. There is logic in this; he is unbiased&mdash;he hates all creative people equally.&mdash;Robert A. Heinlein

## Useful History
Sat, 17 Feb 2018

"A great deal of false history was written, by people who never strayed north of London, about working-class hardship in those parts. Yes, there was plenty, but what we get from the entrepreneurs of socialism is twisted to their agitprop needs. Rewriting the history, to make it more true, makes another nice hobby; and in the course of it we discover that the ugliest of the capitalists often did less damage than the philanthropists."&mdash;<a href="https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2018/02/16/as-the-world-turns-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">David Warren</a>

## Turning and Turning
Sat, 17 Feb 2018

Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.
Surely some revelation is at hand;
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out   
When a vast image out of <em>Spiritus Mundi</em> 
Troubles my sight: a waste of desert sand;   
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,   
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,   
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it   
Wind shadows of the indignant desert birds.   
The darkness drops again; but now I know   
That twenty centuries of stony sleep 
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,   
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,   
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born? 
&mdash; William Butler Yeats, 1919

## The Source of All Evil
Sun, 18 Feb 2018

"IF I had only one sermon to preach, it would be a sermon against Pride. The more I see of existence, and especially of modern practical and experimental existence, the more I am convinced of the reality of the old religious thesis; that all evil began with some attempt at superiority; some moment when, as we might say, the very skies were cracked across like a mirror, because there was a sneer in Heaven."&mdash;G.K. Chesterton: <em>If I Had Only One Sermon To Preach</em>

## What a Long, Strange Trip...
Wed, 21 Feb 2018

<blockquote>"Sometimes the light's all shining on me
 Other times I can barely see
 Lately it occurs to me
 What a long, strange trip it's been."&mdash;Hunter/Garcia</blockquote>
Steven Pressfield <a href="http://www.stevenpressfield.com/2018/02/untitled-book-installment-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted this</a> today:
<blockquote>I have a theory about the Hero&rsquo;s Journey. We all have one. We have many, in fact. But our primary hero&rsquo;s journey as artists is the passage we live out, in real life, before we find our calling.
The hero&rsquo;s journey is the search for that calling.
It&rsquo;s preparation.
It&rsquo;s initiation (or more precisely, self-initiation).
On the hero&rsquo;s journey, we see, we experience, we suffer. We learn.
On our hero&rsquo;s journey, we acquire a history that is ours alone. It&rsquo;s a secret history, a private history, a personal history. No one has it but us. No one knows it but us. This secret history is the most valuable possession we hold, or ever will hold. We will draw upon it for the rest of our lives.
The hero&rsquo;s journey ends when, like Odysseus, we return home to Ithaca, to the place from which we started. We wash up on shore. We have survived. We have come home.
Now what?</blockquote>
Well, what? There's a calling, that calling, the one that's mysteriously been whispering and talking and yelling and screaming obscenities at you/me all along. Only now, it's explicit. It's there, not "out there" but "right there" and there's some question but not much and not enough to put it off anymore.
Now what?
It's been a long, strange trip, and it isn't over. Hell, it's not much more than just started.
Now what?

## Morally Homeless
Thu, 22 Feb 2018

"As we should be genuinely sorry for tramps and paupers who are materially homeless, so we should be sorry for those who are morally homeless, and who suffer a philosophical starvation as deadly as physical starvation."&mdash;G.K. Chesterton: <em>Illustrated London News, Nov. 24, 1934.</em>
With a hat tip to the <a href="https://gkcdaily.blogspot.com/2018/02/for-those-who-are-morally-homeless.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GKCDaily</a> blog...

## Scorn Not
Thu, 22 Feb 2018

&ldquo;O MAN, scorn not that which is admirable in you! You are a poor thing in your own eyes, but I would teach you that in reality you are a great thing! . . . Realize what you are! Consider your royal dignity! The heavens have not been made in God&rsquo;s image as you have, nor the moon, nor the sun, nor anything to be seen in creation. . . . Behold, of all that exists there is nothing that can contain your greatness.&rdquo;&mdash;St. Gregory of Nyssa (c. 335&mdash;c. 395): <em>In Cantica, Homily 2.</em>

## Projection/Empathy
Thu, 22 Feb 2018

<blockquote>The monologue that runs in our brain is loud. It's heavy-metal loud compared to the quiet signals we get from the rest of the world.
All day, every day, that noise keeps going. It's the only voice that has seen everything we've seen, believes everything we believe. It's the noise that not only criticizes every action of every other person who disagrees with us, but it criticizes their motives as well. And, if we question it, it criticizes us as well.
Is it any wonder that projection is more powerful than empathy?
When we meet people, we either celebrate when they agree with us or plot to change or ignore them when they don't. There's not a lot of room for, "they might have a different experience of this moment than I do."
That noise in our head is selfish, afraid and angry. That noise is self-satisfied, self-important and certain. That noise pushes intimacy away and will do anything it can to degrade those that might challenge us.
But, against all odds, empathy is possible.
It's possible to amplify those too-quiet signals that others send us and to practice imagining, even for a moment, what it might be like to have their noise instead of our noise.
If we put in the effort and devote the time to practice this skill, we can get better at it. We merely have to begin.</blockquote>

## You cannot...
Fri, 23 Feb 2018

<blockquote>You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift.
You cannot help small men by tearing down big men.
You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong.
You cannot lift the wage-earner by pulling down the wage-payer.
You cannot help the poor man by destroying the rich.
You cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than your income.
You cannot further the brotherhood of man by inciting class hatred.
You cannot establish security on borrowed money.
You cannot build character and courage by taking away men's initiative and independence.
You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could and should do for themselves.</blockquote>
&mdash; William Boetcker, 1873&mdash;1962

## What You Believe
Sat, 24 Feb 2018

"I have found that the greatest help in meeting any problem with decency, self-respect, and whatever courage may be required, is to know where you, yourself, stand. That is, to have in words what you believe, and are acting from."&mdash;William Faulkner

## That Within Me
Sat, 24 Feb 2018

<blockquote>But I have lived, and have not lived in vain:
My mind may lose its force, my blood its fire,
And my frame perish even in conquering pain,
But there is that within me which shall tire
Torture and Time, and breathe when I expire:
Something unearthly, which they deem not of,
Like the remembered tone of a mute lyre,
Shall on their softened spirits sink, and move
In hearts all rocky now the late remorse of love.</blockquote>
&mdash; Lord Byron; <em>Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</em> CXXXVII

## The Inquiry of Truth
Mon, 26 Feb 2018

"The inquiry of truth, which is the love-making or wooing of it; the knowledge of truth, which is the presence of it; and the belief in truth, which is the enjoying of it&mdash;is the sovereign good of human nature."&mdash;Sir Francis Bacon, 1st Viscount St. Alban

## Our Times
Sat, 10 Mar 2018

"War, by imposing hardships and controls on daily life, produces an aggressive mentality and degrades people's character according to their wretched conditions. The result in this case was a general state of public disorder in all countries. As time went on and the earlier atrocities became an accepted fact, the later ones were marked by refinements of technique and novel methods of retaliation. Even words lost their proper meanings and were changed to suit current propaganda . . . . family ties were broken for the sake of party loyalty. . . . Relations between people were governed not by the security of established customs but by the prospect of selfish gain in defiance of the law."
Does this sound familiar? Is this an apt description of our lifetime and that of our parents (or grandparents, that Greatest Generation)? These words were written by Thucydides to describe Athens as it warred with Sparta (ca. 400 B.C.).

## Trivial and Great Truths
Mon, 12 Mar 2018

"There are trivial truths and there are great truths. The opposite of a trivial truth is plainly false. The opposite of a great truth is also true."&mdash;Niels Bohr

## Authoritative
Mon, 19 Mar 2018

Christianity has projected Jesus as the long-suffering, meek, and gentle "lamb of God." The Gospels present another picture: Gentle and compassionate, yes, but the Jesus of these pages is predominantly strong, candid, and above all <em>authoritative</em>. As Harold points out:
<blockquote>At the time, people did not marvel so much at what Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount as at the <em>authority</em> with which He spoke:
<blockquote>"...the people were astonished at his doctrine; for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes."</blockquote>
Today, "scribes" have rewritten these words. In <em>The New English Bible</em>, read the translation thirteen scholars offer to men whose souls are starved, and scared, and scarred&mdash;it is a timid bit:
<blockquote>". . . he taught with a note of authority."</blockquote>
The translators write in the tenor of their age&mdash;a "note" of faith in anything, a "note" of authority in anything, is all that is left. But because of this, the twentieth century is a time pregnant with the possibility of grasping truth, for now man must seek the authority within himself.</blockquote>
&mdash;Winifred Babcock, <em>Jung-Hesse-Harold</em>, p. 35, quoting Preston Harold, <em>The Shining Stranger</em>, p. 256

## Pure, Simple Truth
Mon, 19 Mar 2018

"The truth is rarely pure, and never simple."&mdash;Oscar Wilde, <em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em>

## Five Stages
Tue, 20 Mar 2018

Every human being, if he lives his normal span, suffers five traumatic events that serve to expand his consciousness and increase his need to know the truth of himself in being: the trauma of birth, of puberty, of recognizing himself to be cast out in solitary being, of losing his sexual competency, of anticipating the loss of his life. Thus, built into his nature are the stresses that periodically &ldquo;flood the cellar&rdquo; of his subconscious mind and free him of much of the &ldquo;conditioned learning&rdquo; society and Babel Tower builders have imposed upon him. Therefore, before death overtakes him, he is free of much of his spurious &ldquo;conditioning.&rdquo;&mdash;Preston Harold, <em>The Shining Stranger</em>, p. 95

## Empathy, not Conscience
Fri, 23 Mar 2018

In man, empathy, not conscience, is the resonator. But conscience has a vital role to play. Just as a satellite must have a continuous sensing of its motion and attitude in space, keeping itself horizontal in relation to the surface of the earth below if it is to perform its complicated maneuvers, so man must have a continuous sense of &ldquo;right or wrong,&rdquo; regardless of the compassion his empathy arouses within him as he views good or evil in this world. Conscience, which is of the closed world of the past, acts as an &ldquo;inertial reference package&rdquo; to balance the course empathy takes.&mdash;Preston Harold, <em>The Shining Stranger</em>, p. 161

## Make politics as local as possible
Fri, 13 Apr 2018

"THE men whom the people ought to choose to represent them are too busy to take the jobs. But the politician is waiting for it. He&rsquo;s the pestilence of modern times. What we should try to do is make politics as local as possible. Keep the politicians near enough to kick them. The villagers who met under the village tree could also hang their politicians to the tree. It is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged."
&mdash; G.K. Chesterton: <em>Cleveland Press</em> interview, March 1, 1921.
<a href="http://www.consultingsmiths.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/hanged.png"><img src="http://www.consultingsmiths.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/hanged-300x229.png" alt="" width="300" height="229" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-992" /></a>

## Spiritual ADD
Fri, 20 Apr 2018

It occurred to me that I have "Spiritual ADD"&mdash;that I'll get an inspiration that bounces all over, then gets lost.

And, since they are real inspirations (at least, sometimes) they'll come back, somewhat evolved, perhaps decades later. "David, it's Me again. Remember this..."

From a note that I left to myself 6 April, 2017

## Needlework
Sat, 05 May 2018

"Saint Luke was a painter, by some accounts, and by others a physician. I think he was both, and more, from acquaintance with his writings. But certainly a physician. When Matthew and Mark recount the saying of Jesus, that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to pass through the gates of heaven, they use the Greek term for a household sewing needle. But Luke instinctively uses the term for a surgeon&rsquo;s suturing needle. Case closed, to my mind."&mdash;<a href="https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2018/05/05/needlework/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">David Warren</a>

## Education and Training
Thu, 31 May 2018

Also, science (intentionally uncapitalized) and engineering:

"Education is what, when, and why to do things. Training is how to do it.

"In science, if you know what you are doing, you should not be doing it. In engineering, if you do not know what you are doing, you should not be doing it."&mdash;Richard Hamming, <em>The Art of Doing Science and Engineering (1997)</em>

## A Brief Note
Thu, 31 May 2018

To my other reader, acknowledging my absence...

Been trying to get into a single-story home, for the sake of our sadly abused knees, etc.

Succeeded three weeks ago, been consumed with "next steps" since then.

Posting may or may not continue to be erratic, but then it's always been like that, hasn't it?

## Criticism and The Web
Thu, 31 May 2018

&ldquo;When I first prepared this particular talk... I realized that my usual approach is usually critical. That is, a lot of the things that I do, that most people do, are because they hate something somebody else has done, or they hate that something hasn't been done. And I realized that informed criticism has completely been done in by the web. Because the web has produced so much uninformed criticism. It&rsquo;s kind of a Gresham&rsquo;s Law&mdash;bad money drives the good money out of circulation. Bad criticism drives good criticism out of circulation. You just can&rsquo;t criticize anything.&rdquo;&mdash;Alan Kay <a href="https://vimeo.com/10260548" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>How Simply and Understandably Could The &lsquo;Personal Computing Experience&rsquo; Be Programmed?</em></a>

## The Language of Nature
Thu, 31 May 2018

&ldquo;We must remember that Galileo merely said that the language of nature is written in mathematics. He did not say everything is. And even the truth about nature need not be expressed in mathematics. For most of human history, the language of nature has been the language of myth and ritual. These forms, one might add, had the virtues of leaving nature unthreatened and of encouraging the belief that human beings are part of it. It hardly befits a people who stand ready to blow up the planet to praise themselves too vigorously for having found the true way to talk about nature.&rdquo; &amp;mdash: Neil Postman <em>Amusing Ourselves to Death</em>

## Power/Corruption
Thu, 31 May 2018

&ldquo;&lsquo;Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.&rsquo; We&rsquo;ve all seen this quote of Lord Acton. Most people agree with it. I don&rsquo;t. Like many (if not most) great quotes, it is dead wrong. Why? Because it&rsquo;s exactly backwards, that&rsquo;s why...

&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s reconstruct Acton&rsquo;s sentence in a way that reflects the truth of the matter (and energy) of power. Put the word &lsquo;man&rsquo; in place of &lsquo;power&rsquo;, and then move the word &lsquo;power&rsquo; behind the word &lsquo;corrupt(s)&rsquo;. Now let&rsquo;s see what it should look like if we&rsquo;re truly seeking the truth: &lsquo;(Man) tends to corrupt power, and absolute (Man) corrupts power absolutely&rsquo;.&rdquo;&mdash;Ianto Watt <a href="http://wmbriggs.com/post/24549/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Lord Acton&rsquo;s Apostasy</em></a>

## The Problem
Sat, 02 Jun 2018

&ldquo;The problem is no longer getting people to express themselves, but providing little gaps of solitude and silence in which they might eventually find something to say. Repressive forces don&rsquo;t stop people from expressing themselves, but rather, force them to express themselves. What a relief to have nothing to say, the right to say nothing, because only then is there a chance of framing the rare, or ever rarer, the thing that might be worth saying.&rdquo;&mdash;Gilles Deleuze

## Joyce&#039;s Reality
Mon, 18 Jun 2018

"Beckett wrote that Joyce believed fervently in the significance of chance events and of random connections.

&lsquo;To Joyce reality was a paradigm, an illustration of a possibly unstateable rule... According to this rule, reality, no matter how much we try to manipulate it, can only shift about in continual movement, yet movement limited in its possibilities...&rsquo; giving rise to &lsquo;the notion of the world where unexpected simultaneities are the rule.&rsquo; In other words, a coincidence such as sitting down to dinner with James Joyce is actually just part of a continually moving pattern, like a kaleidoscope. Or Joyce likes to put it, a &lsquo;collideorscape&rsquo;&rdquo;.&mdash;Gabrielle Carey <em><a href="https://sydneyreviewofbooks.com/breaking-james-joyce/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Breaking Up With James Joyce</a></em>

## We Must Sin
Mon, 18 Jun 2018

"According to Ellman, Joyce&rsquo;s view of sin was influenced by Hermann Suderman&rsquo;s play Magda: &lsquo;Magda&rsquo;s philosophy of life may well have helped to shape Joyce&rsquo;s. As she says, &ldquo;And one thing more, my friend&mdash;sin! We must sin if we wish to grow. To become greater than our sins is worth more than all the purity you preach.&rdquo;&rdquo;"&mdash;Gabrielle Carey <em><a href="https://sydneyreviewofbooks.com/breaking-james-joyce/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Breaking Up With James Joyce</a></em>
Is the nature of reality binary, dual? Is it in some way Gnostic, in that good deeds have those side effects of evil, and evil deeds have some atom of good? What does Preston Howard have to say about that?


## Speaking of Wealth or Power
Thu, 28 Jun 2018

"The only man who should speak of wealth or power is one who did not extend his hand when they were within his reach"&mdash;Don Colacho (Nicolás Gómez Dávila)

## Poetry

"<strong>John Keating</strong>:  We don&rsquo;t read and write poetry because it&rsquo;s cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for. To quote from Whitman, &ldquo;O me! O life! &rdquo;¦ of the questions of these recurring; of the endless trains of the faithless &rdquo;¦ of cities filled with the foolish; what good amid these, O me, O life?&rdquo; Answer. That you are here&mdash;that life exists, and identity; that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. That the powerful play *goes on* and you may contribute a verse. What will your verse be?"&mdash;<em>Dead Poets Society (1989)</em> h/t <a href="http://epsilontheory.com/clever-hans/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epsilon Theory (Dr. Ben W. Hunt)</a>

"If there were more bloody noses, there'd be fewer wars."&mdash;<em>Hagbard Celene</em> in <em>The Illumninatus!</em> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/5752454.Robert_Shea?page=2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">R. Shea</a> and R. A. Wilson

## Absurdum
Wed, 04 Jul 2018

"For the first time in history, we have reached a stage of absurdity in which a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> is no longer viable as a rhetorical maneuver, for there is nothing so absurd that everyone recognizes it as such."&mdash;<a href="http://takimag.com/article/street_corner_semantics_theodore_dalrymple/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Theodore Dalrymple</a>
History covers a long time and a lot of absurdity, but this is pretty clearly true &ndash;  least in my lifetime.

## Kings, Silverware and Olympus
Tue, 17 Jul 2018

"The Constitution, written by men with some experience of actual government, assumes that the chief executive will work to be king, the Parliament will scheme to sell off the silverware, and the judiciary will consider itself Olympian and do everything it can to much improve (destroy) the work of the other two branches. So the Constitution pits them against each other, in the attempt not to achieve stasis, but rather to allow for the constant corrections necessary to prevent one branch from getting too much power for too long."&mdash;<a href="https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2008/03/mamets_revelation.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">David Mamet</a>

## Horrible Old Person
Sat, 21 Jul 2018

"I&rdquo;ve become a horrible person in my old age.  And that goes way beyond falling asleep so hard that I slept through my alarm and left my poor long-suffering blog fans waiting for hours in vain. No, I&rdquo;ve become one of those terrible people that Heinlein talks about who tell the unvarnished truth in social situations."&mdash;<a href="https://accordingtohoyt.com/2018/07/21/art-and-craft/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sarah Hoyt</a>
Mea Culpa&mdash;if not "the unvarnished truth" at least my honest opinion.

## The Problem of Evil
Tue, 07 Aug 2018

&ldquo;NO EVIL as such can be desirable, either by natural appetite or by conscious will. It is sought indirectly, namely because it is a consequence of some good. This is the rule for every type of appetite. A natural force works for a form, not the absence of form. Yet one form may extrude another. A lion kills for food, that means the death of the deer; a fornicator wants pleasure, and incurs the deformity of sin.&rdquo;&mdash;St. Thomas Aquinas: <em>Summa Theologica</em>, I, q. 19, a. 9.

## Deciding
Mon, 13 Aug 2018

"<em>How</em> people decide, in what direction they decide, is something we cannot (and should not try to) control&mdash;although we should try to influence for Good in whatever honest and personal fashion presents itself."&mdash;<a href="http://albionawakening.blogspot.com/2018/08/why-recent-suppression-of-conspiracy.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Bruce Charlton</a>

## The True Ruling Power
Tue, 21 Aug 2018

&ldquo;The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.&rdquo;&mdash;Edward Bernays <em>Propaganda</em> 1928

"The plural of anecdote is data."&mdash;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080523225000/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0407a&amp;L=ads-l&amp;P=8874" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fred R. Shapiro</a>

I may have posted this before, but while trying to clean out my office before moving (yet again) I came across the scrap of paper that I'd jotted it down on when I first heard it, and wanted to be sure that I got it here with proper attribution before I tossed the paper.

## Minority Rule
Sun, 02 Sep 2018

It suffices for an intransigent minority&mdash;a certain type of intransigent minority&mdash;to reach a minutely small level, say three or four percent of the total population, for the entire population to have to submit to their preferences.&mdash;Nassim Nicholas Taleb, <a href="https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"The Most Intolerant Wins: The Dictatorship of the Small Minority"</a>

"We don't even know if it's scientifically possible for a non-American to go to the moon. It's never happened."&mdash;Frank J. Fleming

## Love of Liberty
Tue, 04 Sep 2018

"The fact is that the average man's love of liberty is nine-tenths imaginary, exactly like his love of sense, justice and truth. He is not actually happy when free; he is uncomfortable, a bit alarmed, and intolerably lonely. Liberty is not a thing for the great masses of men. It is the exclusive possession of a small and disreputable minority, like knowledge, courage and honor. It takes a special sort of man to understand and enjoy liberty&mdash;and he is usually an outlaw in democratic societies."&mdash;H. L. Mencken

## Models
Mon, 10 Sep 2018

"Yet my explicit metaphysical foundation is that ultimate reality is personal, not abstract&mdash;my bottom line is that reality is made up of beings (variously alive and conscious beings). Abstractions are therefore merely models&mdash;therefore (being models) always simplified and always incomplete and always not-true... no matter how expedient or useful in limited circumstances."&mdash;<a href="https://charltonteaching.blogspot.com/2018/01/not-process-but-provenance-and-polarity.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bruce Charlton</a>

## Homo Economicus?
Mon, 15 Oct 2018

"Theological error is at the root of all other errors of the Modern Age. The idea that man&rsquo;s most fundamental nature is that of a homo economicus, a rational agent whose chief end is material possession, is the common basis of both economic liberalism or capitalism and socialism. At its heart it is a denial of the classical and Christian idea that man has a spiritual as well as a physical nature and that the spiritual ought to rule the animal nature. The idea that most or all of human suffering can be eliminated by reorganizing society economically, socially, and politically is rooted in the ancient heresy of Pelagianism for it is a denial of the fact that since the Fall, human nature itself has been afflicted with the flaw of Original Sin, which is the true source of all human suffering, an affliction for which there is no economic, social, or political cure."&mdash;<a href="http://thronealtarliberty.blogspot.com/2018/09/assorted-reflections.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gerry T.

## God does not ask us...
Mon, 15 Oct 2018

"When the Church emerged from the catacombs after Constantine won the battle of the Milvan Bridge and the Church was no longer persecuted, there came freedom and, worse, respectability. So with this freedom came terrible danger, a danger that is now convulsing the Church, namely what might be called the Imperialization of the Latin West. The pagans poured into the Church. This was a new organization, albeit sacred, where future generations could climb the ladder to power and wealth.

From the moment that the Roman Church, and to a certain extent the Byzantine Church, took on the bureaucracy of the Roman Empire as a model for its working structures, there was a foothold for the Devil. In the hands of a Gregory the Great it was safe, but when popes, cardinals, and bishops became worldly and ambitious then there was more than a whiff of danger, there were darkness and a terrible thing. What was this terrible thing? It was nothing more and nothing less than the re-crucifying of Christ, not by out and out sinners such as gangsters, murderers, and heartless dictators, but by Popes, bishops, and cardinals, and by far, far too many priests infatuated with ambition, wealth, power, and sensuality.

We must reflect profoundly on the fact that the great St. John Chrysostom and the utterly gentle Robert Bellarmine thought that most bishops go to Hell.  We priests are in no better state, as witnessed by that other great saint, Alphonsus Liguori, who said that most priests go to Hell. Today the great temptation among Catholics, and the mainstream Protestant churches, is the First Temptation of Christ; namely, to turn stones into bread.  As long as we are involved solely in the social Gospel, then that is all that is needed.  This Utopian style Christianity best incarnated in Liberation Theology is exactly what Christ speaks against, when Satan tempts Him to assuage his hunger by turning stones into bread. We must in our materialistic age reflect on Christ&rsquo;s response to Satan, &ldquo;Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God&rdquo; (Matthew 4: 4 ). When we become engrossed on feeding and clothing the World&rsquo;s population and getting everyone jobs, noble as this effort is, it is not enough. There is only one thing that is enough, and that is that we give ourselves totally and utterly to God, holding nothing back.  However, because we are human most of us fail miserably, and before long there are programmes put into place that are anything but Christian.

God does not ask us to be successful, he asks us to be faithful."&mdash;<a href="https://www.lifesitenews.com/opinion/awake-and-do-your-duty-a-hermits-open-letter-to-catholic-bishops-amid-abuse" rel="noopener" target="_blank">An Anonymous Hermit Priest</a>

## Drowning in Thought
Mon, 22 Oct 2018

He took me into his room, which smelt strongly of tobacco, and took out a book from one of the heaps,  turned the leaves and looked for the passage.

"This is good, too, very good," he said, "listen to this: 'A man should be proud of suffering. All suffering is a reminder of our high estate.' Fine! Eighty years before Nietzsche. But that is not the sentence I meant. Wait a moment, here I have it. This: 'Most men will not swim before they are able to.' Is not that witty? Naturally, they will not swim! They are born for the solid earth, not for the water. And naturally they won't think. They are made for life, not for thought. Yes, and he who thinks, what's more, he who makes thought his business, he may go far in it, but he has bartered the solid earth for the water all the same, and one day he will drown."&mdash;Hermann Hesse <em>Steppenwolf</em>

## The Marriage at Cana

Reading this blog post today from <a href="http://charltonteaching.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-marriage-and-miracle-at-cana-fourth.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bruce Charlton</a> and following interior link after link, I found some interesting "links" to Thomas Troward's thoughts on the "process" of G_d desiring a "conversation" and beginning the creation by "becoming" a dyad&mdash;a second Person. Since we're in the middle of actually moving stuff into the new house, there's no time to say more, just marking this with the thought that I'll be back.

## What embitters the world
Wed, 21 Nov 2018

"WHAT embitters the world is not excess of criticism, but absence of self-criticism. It is comparatively of little consequence that you occasionally break out and abuse other people, so long as you do not absolve yourself. The former is a natural collapse of human weakness; the latter is a blasphemous assumption of divine power. And in the modern world, where everybody is quarrelling about the urgent necessity of peace, nobody notices how this notion has really poisoned the relations of nations and men."&mdash;G.K. Chesterton: &ldquo;On Bright Old Things and Other Things,&rdquo; in <em>Sidelights on New London and Newer New York</em>.

## Trusting the Process
Mon, 26 Nov 2018

I love how just following the basic plan for hyperspace, link to link to yet another tenuously related source, I end up discovering new resources, new people, often long dead, whose thoughts all tie again into that "eternal golden braid."&mdash;Email note to self last Tuesday, triggered by whatever linked me to Bruce Charleton, the Inklings, Owen Barfield.

## Democracy
Fri, 14 Dec 2018

&ldquo;Stephen&rsquo;s mind wandered away on the subject of authority, its nature, origin, base or bases: authority whether innate of acquired, and if acquired then by what means? Authority as opposed to mere power, how exactly to be defined? Its etymology: its relation to <em>auctor</em>. From these thoughts he was aroused by an expectant silence opposite him, and looking up he saw Dutourd and Vidal looking at him across the table, their forks poised: reaching back in his mind he caught the echo of a question: &lsquo;What do you think of democracy?&rsquo;

&lsquo;The gentleman was asking what you thought of democracy, sir,&rsquo; said Vidal, smiling.

&lsquo;Alas I cannot tell you, sir,&rsquo; said Stephen, returning the smile. &lsquo;For although it would not be proper to call this barque or vessel a King&rsquo;s ship except in the largest sense, we nevertheless adhere strictly to the naval tradition which forbids discussion of religion, women, or politics in our mess. It has been objected that this rule makes insipidity, which may be so; yet on the other hand it has it uses, since in this case for example it prevents any member from wounding any other gentleman present by saying that he did not think the policy that put Socrates to death and that left Athens prostrate was the highest expression of human wisdom, or by quoting Aristotle&rsquo;s definition of democracy as mob rule, the depraved version of a commonwealth.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Patrick O&rsquo;Brien, <em>The Wine-Dark Sea</em>

## Medieval Minds
Mon, 17 Dec 2018

&ldquo;But if we scrutinize the men of the Middle Ages more closely, contrasting them with ourselves, we shall find something yet more significant. And it is this, that they identified <em>themselves</em> with their thoughts. This is of the utmost importance. It is this that is at the bottom of all that strikes a modern observer as most incomprehensible and alien about the men of that time&mdash;for example, their intolerance. Identifying the thought with the words, they felt that truth could be wholly embodied in creed and dogma, and identifying the self with the thought, they were&mdash;quite rightly&mdash;intolerant. A wrong thought could strike them as far more immoral than a wrong action.&rdquo;&mdash;Owen Barfield <em>Romanticism Comes of Age</em> p. 54
An example of a key "Barfieldian" concept&mdash;that we are profoundly different from our ancestors, that their experience of both external and interior realities was incomprehensibly different from ours.

## Walking About

&ldquo;Tradition refuses to submit to the small and arrogant oligarchy of those who merely happen to be walking about.&rdquo;&mdash;G. C. Chesterton, <em>Orthodoxy</em>

## The Message
Sat, 22 Dec 2018

&ldquo;Many Catholics have forgotten that the Church is established for the forgiveness of sins and the proclamation of the gospel, and believe instead that the Church is here to make the world a better place, and that this needs to be accomplished by all sorts of educational, social welfare, political and even revolutionary activities.
&ldquo;Preachers, priests and prelates have decided Jesus&rsquo; kingdom really is of this world after all and have exchanged the gospel of salvation for the gospel of political activism. They are more concerned with saving the planet than saving souls.
&ldquo;Tell it straight. This is the message of anti-Christ.&rdquo;&mdash;<a href="https://dwightlongenecker.com/advent-apostasy-and-the-anti-christ/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fr. Dwight Longnecker</a>

## Profination
Sat, 22 Dec 2018

&ldquo;St. Mary&rsquo;s Church in Dublin, Ireland, built at the beginning of the 18th century and closed in 1964, was abandoned for a number of years until it was bought and transformed into a restaurant and bar in 1997. The transformation was given the Dublin City Neighborhood Awards 2006, where it won first prize in the category of Best Old Building. Now it goes by the name of The Church Bar and Restaurant.
&ldquo;The travel destinations section of The Telegraph (London) notes that, at the historic heart of Assisi, Italy, you may enjoy the <em>Nun Assisi Relais and Spa and Museum</em>: &ldquo;This stylish convent-turned-design-hotel enjoys a quiet spot in the historical heart of Assisi. An inspired renovation not only transformed the 13th-century structure into a sleek, minimalist haven; but also uncovered the ruins of a Roman amphitheater&mdash;now home to an atmospheric &lsquo;spa museum&rdquo;.&rdquo;

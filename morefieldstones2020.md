## Conversation
Friday, 07 February 2020

“[This argument] fixes its attention on the forms of human conversation, and postulates that how we are obliged to conduct such conversations will have the strongest possible influence on what ideas we can conveniently express. And what ideas are convenient to express inevitably become the important content of a culture.”—Neil Postman, *Amusing Ourselves to Death*

## Education and Training
Friday, 07 February 2020

“Education is what, when, and why to do things. Training is how to do it.

“In science, if you know what you are doing, you should not be doing it. In engineering, if you do not know what you are doing, you should not be doing it.”—Richard Hamming, *The Art of Doing Science and Engineering* (1997)

## Fully Automatic Model
Monday, 03 February 2020

“The world-conquering West of the nineteenth century needed a philosophy of life in which realpolitik—victory for the tough people who face the bleak facts—was the guiding principle. Thus the bleaker the facts you face, the tougher you seem to be. So we vied with each other to make the Fully Automatic Model of the universe as bleak as possible.”—Bernardo Kastrup, *More Than Allegory: On Religious Myth, Truth and Belief*

## Beasts
Monday, 03 February 2020

“The beasts of modernism have mutated into the beasts of postmodernism—relativism into nihilism, amorality into immorality, irrationality into insanity, sexual deviancy into polymorphous perversity. And since then, generations of intelligent students under the guidance of their enlightened professors have looked into the abyss, have contemplated those beasts, and have said, “How interesting, how exciting.”—Gertrude Himmelfarb, *On Looking into the Abyss* (1994)

## Course of Study
Saturday, 01 February 2020

“I would not advise a rigid adherence to a particular plan of study . . . . A man ought to read just as inclination leads him, for what he reads as a task will do him little good.”–James Boswell, *Life of Samuel Johnson*, quoting Johnson

## Learned Lumber
Saturday, 01 February 2020

“The bookish blockhead, ignorantly read,

With loads of learned lumber in his head.”—Alexander Pope, *Essay on Criticism* (1711)

## Common Sense, Hedonistic World-view
Monday, 27 January 2020

“By contrast, Hitler is a criminal lunatic... yet Hitler has an army of millions of men, aeroplanes in thousands, tanks in tens of thousands. For his sake a great nation has been willing to overwork itself for six years and then to fight for two years more, whereas for the common-sense, essentially hedonistic world-view which Mr. Wells puts forward, hardly a human creature is willing to shed a pint of blood.”—George Orwell, *[Wells, Hitler and the world State](https://orwell.ru/library/reviews/wells/english/e_whws)* (1941)

## Physics Is
Friday, 24 January 2020

“The first step is to reject the misguided belief that ‘everything is physical’, and replace it with a much more humble—but true—thesis: only observation is physical. Physics is the science of observation.”—[Adur Alkain](https://www.bernardokastrup.com/2020/01/guest-essay-marriage-of-physics-and_24.html)

Which is to say, save the appearances?

## Bodies
Friday, 24 January 2020

“Man has no Body distinct from his soul; for that called Body is a portion of a Soul discerned by the five senses, the chief inlets of Soul in this age.”—William Blake, *The Marriage of Heaven and Hell*

## Prudence
Wednesday, 22 January 2020

“An ounce of prudence is worth a pound of cleverness.”—Baltasar Gracian (1601-1658)

## Escape
Wednesday, 22 January 2020

“The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane.”—Marcus Aurelius

## Opinion Ghettos
Wednesday, 22 January 2020

“People are only your friends in opinion ghettos as long as you agree with them.”-[James Altucher](https://jamesaltucher.com/blog/i-dont-give-a-s/)

## Tools
Monday, 20 January 2020

“A convivial society should be designed to allow all its members the most autonomous action by means of tools least controlled by others. People feel joy, as opposed to mere pleasure, to the extent that their activities are creative; while the growth of tools beyond a certain point increases regimentation, dependence, exploitation, and impotence.”—Ivan Illich, *Tools for Conviviality* (1973)

## Breakdown
Friday, 17 January 2020

“Cultures spring from religions; ultimately the vital force which maintains any culture is its philosophy, its attitude toward the universe; the decay of a religion involves the decay of the culture corresponding to it—we see that most clearly in the breakdown of Christendom today.”—Hilaire Belloc: *The Great Heresies*

## Eyore
Thursday, 16 January 2020

“Eeyore’s pessimism is the expression of inadequacy and fear. I distinguish the right kind of pessimism, which means simply recognizing the deep incompetence of human nature, from the wrong kind, which tells us to stop hoping.”—Roger Scruton,  (27 February 1944 – 12 January 2020)

## Perfection
Thursday, 16 January 2020

“It seems that perfection is finally attained, not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away.”—Antoine de Saint-Exupery, *Terre des Hommes* (1939)

## Vain Hope
Monday, 13 January 2020

“The hope that new experiments will lead us back to objective events in time and space is about as well founded as the hope of discovering the end of the world in the unexplored regions of the Antarctic.”—Werner Heisenberg, quoted in Nick Herbert, *Quantum Reality: Beyond the New Physics*

## Natural Science
Monday, 13 January 2020

“Natural science does not simply describe and explain nature; it is part of the interplay between nature and ourselves; it describes nature as exposed to our method of questioning.”—Werner Heisenberg, *Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science* (1959)

## Absurdity
Monday, 13 January 2020

“I remember discussions with Bohr which went through many hours till very late at night and ended almost in despair; and when at the end of the discussion I went alone for a walk in the neighboring park I repeated to myself again and again the question: Can nature possibly be as absurd as it seemed to us in these atomic experiments?”—Werner Heisenberg, *Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science* (1958)

## Evil
Monday, 13 January 2020

“The evil man destroys even himself.”—Aristotle, *Nicomachean Ethics*

## Atoms
Monday, 13 January 2020

“According to Democritus, atoms had lost the qualities like colour, taste, etc., they only occupied space, but geometrical assertions about atoms were admissible and required no further analysis. In modern physics, atoms lose this last property, they possess geometrical qualities in no higher degree than colour, taste, etc. The atom of modern physics can only be symbolized by a partial differential equation in an abstract multidimensional space. Only the experiment of an observer forces the atom to indicate a position, a colour and a quantity of heat. All the qualities of the atom of modern physics are derived, it has no immediate and direct physical properties at all, i.e. every type of visual conception we might wish to design is, *eo ipso*, faulty. An understanding of ‘the first order’ is, I would almost say by definition, impossible for the world of atoms.”—Werner Heisenberg, *Philosophic Problems of Nuclear Science*, trans. F. C. Hayes (1952)

“Atoms are neither things nor objects...atoms are part of observational situations.”—Werner Heisenberg, *Physics and Beyond: Encounters and Conversations* (1972)



## Science
Monday, 13 January 2020

“I am very astonished that the scientific picture of the real world around me is deficient. It gives a lot of factual information, puts all our experience in a magnificently consistent order, but it is ghastly silent about all and sundry that is really near to our heart, that really matters to us. It cannot tell us a word about red and blue, bitter and sweet, physical pain and physical delight; it knows nothing of beautiful and ugly, good or bad, God and eternity. Science sometimes pretends to answer questions in these domains, but the answers are very often so silly that we are not inclined to take them seriously.”—Erwin Schrödinger, *Nature and the Greeks* (1954)

## Consciousness
Monday, 13 January 2020

“Consciousness is never experienced in the plural, only in the singular. Not only has none of us ever experienced more than one consciousness, but there is also no trace of circumstantial evidence of this ever happening anywhere in the world. If I say that there cannot be more than one consciousness in the same mind, this seems a blunt tautology–we are quite unable to imagine the contrary.”—Erwin Schrödinger, *The Arithmetical Paradox: The Oneness of Mind* in *What Is Life?* (1944)

“For thousands of years men have striven and suffered and begotten and woman have brought forth in pain. A hundred years ago, perhaps, another man sat on this spot; like you he gazed with awe and yearning in his heart at the dying light on the glaciers. Like you he was begotten of man and born of woman. He felt pain and brief joy as you do. Was he someone else? Was it not you yourself? What is this Self of yours? What was the necessary condition for making the thing conceived this time into you, just you and not someone else?”—Erwin Schrödinger, *Seek for the Road* (1925)

## Mere
Monday, 13 January 2020

“But my interest was drawn not only to the noun in the title of Bejan’s book but also to the adjective: mere. Her use of that word delighted me. Like a lover of endangered species, the lover of endangered words jumps for joy when he sees a word being rescued, and is grateful when a writer restores to currency a semantic possibility that had fallen into desuetude. It is as if a lovely antique table has been rediscovered after many years of gathering dust up in the attic, and when brought downstairs and cleaned up and polished, imparts a splendor and unbought grace to the room that no shiny new object could possibly match.”—[Wilfred M. McClay](https://hedgehogreview.com/issues/eating-and-being/articles/mere)

## Truth
Saturday, 11 January 2020

“Truth is not that which is demonstrable but that which is unavoidable.”—Antoine de Saint-Exupery

## Committment
Saturday, 11 January 2020

“At the moment of commitment the entire universe conspires to assist you.”—Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe

## Choosing Evil
Saturday, 11 January 2020

“No man chooses evil because it is evil; he only mistakes it for happiness, the good he seeks.”—Mary Wollstonecraft

## Precision
Saturday, 11 January 2020

“There’s no sense in being precise when you don’t even know what you’re talking about”—John Von Neumann (unsourced)

## Expression
Saturday, 11 January 2020

“I know more than I can express in words, and the little I can express would not have been expressed, had I not known more.”—Vladimir Nabokov, *Strong Opinions*

## Anger
Saturday, 11 January 2020

“To be angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, in the right way—that is not easy.”—Aristotle, *Nicomachean Ethics*

## Editing
Wednesday, 08 January 2020

“A simple editing trick:

“Every sentence has a purpose. It doesn’t exist to take up space. It exists to change the reader, to move her from here to there.

“This sentence, then, what’s it for?

“If it doesn’t move us closer to where we seek to go, delete it.”—[Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/2020/01/what-is-this-sentence-supposed-to-do/)

## Madness
Saturday, 04 January 2020

“Madness is rare in individuals—but in groups, parties, nations, and ages it is the rule.”—Nietzche

## Muggeridge’s Law
Thursday, 02 January 2020

“Satire can never compete with real life for its sheer absurdity.”

“While Malcolm Muggeridge was the editor of Punch, it was announced that Khrushchev and Bulganin were coming to England. Muggeridge hit upon the idea of a mock itinerary, a lineup of the most ludicrous places the two paunchy pear-shaped little Soviet leaders could possibly be paraded through during the solemn process of a state visit. Shortly before press time, half the feature had to be scrapped. It coincided exactly with the official itinerary, just released, prompting Muggeridge to observe: We live in an age in which it is no longer possible to be funny. There is nothing you can imagine, no matter how ludicrous, that will not promptly be enacted before your very eyes, probably by someone well known.”—Tom Wolfe, “Stalking the Billion-Footed Beast: A literary manifesto for the new social novel”, *Harpers*, November, 1989

## Sowell’s Law
Thursday, 02 January 2020prin

“In human problems, there are no solutions, only trade-offs.”

## Sumner’s Law
Thursday, 02 January 2020

“The type and formula of most schemes of philanthropy or humanitarianism is this: A and B put their heads together to decide what C shall be made to do for D. The radical vice of all these schemes, from a sociological point of view, is that C is not allowed a voice in the matter, and his position, character, and interests, as well as the ultimate effects on society through C’s interests, are entirely overlooked. […A and B] ignore entirely the source from which they must draw all the energy which they employ in their remedies, and they ignore all the effects on other members of society than the ones they have in view. […T]he State cannot get a cent for any man without taking it from some other man, and this latter must be a man [C] who has produced and saved it. This latter is the Forgotten Man.”—William Graham Sumner, *The Forgotten Man*

## Heinlein’s Dichotomy
Thursday, 02 January 2020

“Political rags—such as royalist, communist, democrat, populist, fascist, liberal, conservative, and so forth—are never basic criteria. The human race divides politically into those who want people to be controlled and those who have no such desire.”—Robert A. Heinlein *The notebooks of Lazarus Long*

## Cognitive Bias
Thursday, 02 January 2020

“Intelligent and educated people are less likely to learn from their mistakes, for instance, or take advice from others. And when they do err, they are better able to build elaborate arguments to justify their reasoning, meaning that they become more and more dogmatic in their views.”—David Robson, *The Intelligence Trap*

## Dysrationalia
Thursday, 02 January 2020

“We have an implicit [but wrong] assumption that intelligence and rationality go together—or else why would we be so surprised when smart people do foolish things?”

“I coined the term “dysrationalia” (analogous to “dyslexia”), meaning the inability to think and behave rationally despite having adequate intelligence, to draw attention to a large domain of cognitive life that intelligence tests fail to assess.”—[Keith E. Stanovich](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rational-and-irrational-thought-the-thinking-that-iq-tests-miss/)

## Practice It
Wednesday, 01 January 2020

“The Games sacred to Zeus were held every four years at the city of Olympia in Greece. The stadium is still there. You can walk through the tunnel that the athletes took to enter the arena and even wriggle your toes into the stone grooves that served in ancient times as starting blocks for the races.

“In those days, the spectators sat city-by-city. The Athenians took their seats all in one section. Same for the Corinthians, Argives, etc.

”The stadium was packed on this particular day, when an elderly gentleman entered seeking a seat.

“No one would get up for him.

“The old man crossed painfully through the Theban section. Nobody stood. The gentleman next entered the Achaean section; again no person vacated his seat. By now the full stadium had noticed the elderly fellow’s ordeal. They began jeering and mocking him. The man worked his way through the sections of two more cities. Still no one stood. The laughter and derision now dominated the entire field.

“The old man next stepped toward the Spartan section. As soon as his foot crossed the margin, every single Spartan stood, offering the gentleman his seat.

“At this, the entire stadium burst into applause. The ovation lasted for minutes. When the cheers finally died down, one spectator turned to his neighbor and observed, ‘See? The Greeks all know what is right. But only the Spartans practice it.’”—[Steven Pressfield](https://stevenpressfield.com/2020/01/2-notes-for-the-new-year/)

<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
<p>Friday, 15 January 2021</p>
<p>“Show me a man who thinks he’s objective and I’ll show you a man who’s deceiving himself,”—Henry Luce</p>
<h2 id="change">Change</h2>
<p>Friday, 15 January 2021</p>
<p>“The world is changed by your example, not by your opinion.”—Paul Coelho</p>
<h2 id="easy-to-please">Easy to Please</h2>
<p>Monday, 11 January 2021</p>
<p>“Though Jesus Christ is very hard to satisfy, He is very easy to please. Think of that and it will help you a little. He is very easy to please, but very hard to satisfy. If you will but let Him in, and you have not much to put on the table. You cannot share much of life because you have not got it, He will be so pleased, if it be but a cup of cold water that you can give him. Let it be something genuine, something real.” – George MacDonald. From the sermon “The Father’s Appeal”, preached in Westminster Chapel.</p>
<h2 id="narrative">Narrative</h2>
<p>Friday, 08 January 2021</p>
<p>“For some years now, the comfortable classes in today’s America have lost track of the fact that control over the public narrative does not equal control over the facts underlying the narrative…Convince yourself that something is true, and the universe has to play along: that’s the mentality of a frighteningly large share of the privileged in America these days.”—<a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/into-the-unknown-region/">John Michael Greer</a></p>
<p>More pithy comments on the falsehoods behind the narrative, and the possible or even likely consequences, can be found there. Worth the read.</p>
<h2 id="rivers-of-blood">Rivers of Blood</h2>
<p>Friday, 08 January 2021</p>
<p>“As I look ahead, I am filled with foreboding; like the Roman, I seem to see”the River Tiber foaming with much blood.”—Enoch Powell MP, quoting Virgil in <em>The Rivers of Blood</em> speech, April 20, 1968</p>
<p>And that was 1968. I remember 1968. I turned 21, but too late to vote in that year. I remember watching much of Hippy evolve into angry thug.</p>
<h2 id="law-abiding">Law Abiding</h2>
<p>Friday, 08 January 2021</p>
<p>“Remember that the people that hid Anne Frank were breaking the law and the people that took her to the camps were enforcing it.”—Seen on a blog and no reference found yet…still looking.</p>
<h2 id="a-magnificent-bribe">A Magnificent Bribe</h2>
<p>Monday, 04 January 2021</p>
<p>“The bargain we are being asked to ratify takes the form of a magnificent bribe. Under the democratic-authoritarian social contract, each member of the community may claim every material advantage, every intellectual and emotional stimulus he may desire, in quantities hardly available hitherto even for a restricted minority: food, housing, swift transportation, instantaneous communication, medical care, entertainment, education. But on one condition: that one must not merely ask for nothing that the system does not provide, but likewise agree to take everything offered, duly processed and fabricated, homogenized and equalized, in the precise quantities that the system, rather than the person, requires. Once one opts for the system no further choice remains. In a word, if one surrenders one’s life at source, authoritarian technics will give back as much of it as can be mechanically graded, quantitatively multiplied, collectively manipulated and magnified.”—Lewis Mumford, <em>Authoritarian and Democratic Technics</em> (1964)</p>
<h2 id="mad-times">Mad Times</h2>
<p>Monday, 04 January 2021</p>
<p>“To be sane in a mad time is bad for the brain, or worse for the heart.”—Wendell Berry, <em>The Mad Farmer Manifesto: The First Amendment</em></p>
<h2 id="our-limited-imagination">Our Limited Imagination</h2>
<p>Monday, 04 January 2021</p>
<p>“Now my own suspicion is that the Universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we <em>can</em> suppose.”–J.B.S. Haldane, <em>Possible World and Other Papers</em> (1927) p.286</p>
<p>“Those who are not shocked when they first come across quantum theory cannot possibly have understood it.”—Niels Bohr, <em>Essays 1932-1957 on Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge</em></p>
<p>“Everything we call real is made of things that cannot be regarded as real.”—Niels Bohr</p>
<p>“I feel very much like Dirac: the idea of a personal God is foreign to me. But we ought to remember that religion uses language in quite a different way from science. The language of religion is more closely related to the language of poetry than to the language of science. True, we are inclined to think that science deals with information about objective facts, and poetry with subjective feelings. Hence we conclude that if religion does indeed deal with objective truths, it ought to adopt the same criteria of truth as science. But I myself find the division of the world into an objective and a subjective side much too arbitrary. The fact that religions through the ages have spoken in images, parables, and paradoxes means simply that there are no other ways of grasping the reality to which they refer. But that does not mean that it is not a genuine reality. And splitting this reality into an objective and a subjective side won’t get us very far.”—Niels Bohr, after the Solvay Converence (1927) quoted by Werner Heisenberg, <em>Physics and Beyond</em> (1971) found at <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr">Wikiquote</a></p>
<h2 id="the-persistent-illusion">The Persistent Illusion</h2>
<p>Monday, 04 January 2021</p>
<p>“Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.”—Albert Einstein</p>
<h2 id="the-road-to-hell">The Road to Hell</h2>
<p>Monday, 04 January 2021</p>
<p>“Hell can’t be made attractive, so the devil makes attractive the road that leads there.”—Saint Basil the Great</p>
<h2 id="indifference">Indifference</h2>
<p>Monday, 04 January 2021</p>
<p>“A rational person can find peace by cultivating indifference to things outside their control.”—Naval Ravikant</p>
<h2 id="cured-of-newspapers">Cured of Newspapers</h2>
<p>Monday, 04 January 2021</p>
<p>“To be completely cured of newspapers, spend a year reading the previous week’s newspapers.”—Nassim Taleb</p>
<p>(ed.) A year? A week, if that! Should work with expert blogs and cable news shows, too.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>There may be times when what is most needed is, not so much a new discovery or a new idea as a different ‘slant’; I mean a comparatively slight readjustment in our way of looking at the things and ideas on which attention is already fixed.</p>
<p>Draw a rectangular glass box in perspective—not too precise perspective (for the receding lines must be kept parallel, instead of converging)—and look at it. It has a front and a back, a top and a bottom. But slide your hand across it in the required direction and look again: you may find that what you thought was the inside of the top has become its outside, while th outside of the front wall has changed to the inside of the back wall, and vice versa. The visual readjustment was slight, for the box has not only turned inside out but is also lying at quite a different angle.</p>
<p>The book which follows has been written in the belief that it might be possible to slide a sort of hand across a good many of the things and ideas upon which the attention of western humanity has been concerned for the last two or three hundred years, and upon which the attention of the East is rapidly becoming fixed in the same way. The helping ‘hand’ which it has been sought to apply in this way is, simply, a <em>sustained</em> acceptance by the reader of the relation assumed by physical science to subsist between human consciousness on the one hand and, on the other, the familiar world of which that consciousness is aware.</p>
<p>Physical science has for a long time stressed the enormous difference between what it investigates as the actual structure of the universe, including the earth, and the phenomena, or appearances, which are presented by that structure to normal human consciousness. In tune with this, most philosophy—at all events since Kant—has heavily emphasized the participation of man’s own mind in the creation, or evocation, of these phenomena. The first three short chapters are largely devoted to reminding the reader of that difference and that participation.</p>
<p>About this conception of the relation between man and nature, which is wholly undisputed outside academic philosophy and largely undisputed within it, two things are noticeable; though they do not appear as yet to have been very widely noticed. One is an omission and the other an assumption.</p>
<p>In the first place, undisputed though it remains, it is (if we except a certain school of genetic psychology, now very much out of fashion) always left out of account is our spproach to any subject outside the sphere of physics—such subjects, for example, as the history of the earth, the history of language, the history of thought. In the second place, it is invariably assumed that, whatever the truth may be about the psychological nexus between man and nature, it is an unchanging one and is the same now as it was when men first appeared on earth.</p>
<p>In this book it is suggested that the assumption arose in the first place through clearly traceable historical causes; that the evidence is in favour of regarding it as illusory; and that its persistence in spite of that evidence is largely due to the omission.</p>
<p>As to the omission: having established the gulf which yawns between the atomic physical structure of nature and the appearances of the familiar world, it is of course possible, it is certainly usual—if we are physicists, to continue undisturbed with our investigations of the unappearing atomic structure, and, if we are philosophers, to leave it at that, being content with the metaphysical curiosity we have produced. It is usual; but it is not really necessary to do so. We could, if we chose, take it seriously; we could keep the gulf steadily in sight, instead of instantly forgetting all about it agian, and see what effect that has on our knowledge of other things, such as the evolution of nature and of man himself. Nor does this seem an unreasonable undertaking, since thesee are both matters, and the relation between them is a matter, to which the participation mentioned four paragraphs back must be at least relevant.</p>
<p>The greater part of this book consists, in fact, of a rudimentary attempt to remedy the omission. But this involves, as already indicated, challenging the assumption; and a good deal of attention has been devoted to that aspect also. The result—and really the substance of the book—is a sort of outline sketch, with one or two parts completed in greater detail, for a history of human consciousness; particularly the consciousness of western humanity during the last three thousand years or so.</p>
<p>Finally, the consequences which flow from abandoning the assumption are found to be very far-reaching; and the last three chapters are concerned, theologically, with the bearing of ‘participation’—viewed now as an historical process—upon the origin, the predicament, and the destiny of man.</p>
<h1 id="i-the-rainbow">I<br/>THE RAINBOW</h1>
<p>Look at a rainbow. While it lasts, it is, or appears to be, a great arc of many colors occupying a position out there in space. It touches the horizon between that chimney and that tree; a line drawn from the sun behind you and passing through your head would pierce the center of the circle of which it is part. And now, before it fades, recollect all you have ever been told about the rainbow and its causes, and ask yourself the question <em>Is it really there?</em></p>
<p>You know, from memory, that if there were a hillside three or four miles nearer than the present horizon, The rainbow would come to earth in front of and not behind it; That, if you walk to the place where the rainbow ends, or seems to end, it would certainly not be ‘there’. In a word, reflection will assure you that the rainbow is the outcome of the sun, the raindrops and your own vision.</p>
<p>When I ask of an intelligible appearance or representation, Is it really there? I usually mean, Is it there independently of my vision? Would it still be there for instance, If I shut my eyes—if I moved towards or away from it. If this is what you also mean by ‘really there’, you will be tempted to add that the raindrops and the sun are really there, but the rainbow is not.</p>
<p>Does it follow that, as soon as anybody sees a rainbow, there ‘is’ one, or, in other words, that there is no difference between an hallucination or a madman’s dream of a rainbow (perhaps on a clear day) and an actual rainbow? Certainly not. You were not the only one to see that rainbow. You had a friend with you. (I forbear asking if you both saw ‘the same’ rainbow, because this is a book about history rather than metaphysics, and these introductory chapters are merely intended to clear away certain misconceptions.) Moreover, through the medium of language, you are well aware that thousands of others have seen rainbows in showery weather; but you have never heard of any sane person claiming to ahve seen one on a sunless or a cloudless day. Therefore, if a man tells you he sees a rainbow on a cloudless day, then, even if you are convinced that he means what he says, and is not simply lying, you will confidently affirm that the rainbow he sees is ‘not there’.</p>
<p>In short, as far as being really there or not is concerned, the practical difference between a dream or hallucination of a rainbow and an actual rainbow is that, although each is a representation or appearance (that is, something which I perceive to be there), the second is a <em>shared</em> or collective representation.</p>
<p>Now look at a tree. It is very different from a rainbow. If you approach it, it will still be ‘there’. Moreover, in this case, you can do more than look at it. You can hear the noise its leaves make in the wind. You can perhaps smell it. You can certainly touch it. Your senses combine to assure you that it is composed of what is called solid matter. Accord to the tree the same treatment that you accorded to the rainbow. Recollect all you have been told about matter and its ultimate structure and ask yourself if the tree is ‘really there’. I am far from affirming dogmatically that the atoms, electrons, nuclei, etc., of which wood, and all matter, is said to be composed, are particular and identifiable objects like drops of rain. But if the ‘particles’ (as I will here call them for convenience) <em>are</em> there, and are all that is there, then, since the ‘particles’ are no more like the thing I call a rainbow, it follows, I think, that—just as a rainbow is the outcome of the raindrops and my vision—so, a tree is the outcome of the particles and my vision and my other sense-perceptions. Whatever the particles themselves may be thought to be, the tree, as such, is a representation. And the difference, for me, between a tree and a complete hallucination of a tree is the same as the difference between a rainbow and an hallucination of a rainbow. In other words, a tree which is ‘really there’ is a collective representation. The fact that a dream tree differs in kind from a real tree, and that it is just silly to try and mix them up, is indeed rather literally a matter of ‘common sense’.</p>
<p>This background of particles is of course presumed in the case of raindrops themselves, no less than in that of trees. The relation, <em>raindrops: rainbows</em>, is a picture or analogy, not an instance, of the relation, <em>particles: representation</em>.</p>
<p>Or again, if anyone likes to press the argument still further and maintain that what is true of the drops must also be true of the particles themselves, and that there is ‘no such thing as an extra-mental reality’, I shall not quarrel with him, but I shall leave him severely alone; because, as I say, this is not a book about metaphysics, and I have no desire to demonstrate that trees or rainbows—or particles—are not ‘really there’—a proposition which perhaps has not much meaning. This book is not being written because the author desires to put forward a theory of perception, but because it seems to him that certain wide consequences flowing from the hastily expanded sciences of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and in particular their physics, have not been sufficiently considered in building up the general twentieth-century picture of the nature of the universe and of the history of the earth and man.</p>
<p>A better term than ‘particles’ would possibly be ‘the unrepresented’, since anything particular which amounts to a representation will always attract further physical analysis. Moreover, the atoms, protons and electrons of modern physics are now perhaps more generally regarded, not as particles, but as notional models or symbols of an unknown supersensible or subsensible base. All I seek to establish in these opening paragraphs is, that, whatever may be thought about the ‘unrepresented’ background of our perceptions, the <em>familiar</em> world which we see and know around us—the blue sky with white clouds in it, the noise of a waterfall or a motor-bus, the shapes of flowers and their scent, the gesture and utterance of animals and the faces of our friends—the world too, which (apart from the special inquiry of physics) experts of all kinds methodically investigate—is a system of collective representations. The time comes when one must either accept this as the truth about the world or reject the theories of physics as an elaborate delusion. We cannot have it both ways.</p>
<h1 id="ii-collective-representations">II<br/>COLLECTIVE REPRESENTATIONS</h1>
<p>A representation is something I percieve to be there. By premising that the everyday world is a system of collective representations, it may be thought that we blur the distinction between the fancied and the actual or, following the everyday use of language, between the apparently there and the really there. But this is not so. It only seems to be so because of the very great emphasis which—especially in the last three or four hundred years—the Western Mind has come to lay on the ingredient of spatial depth in the total complex of its perception. I shall return to this later.</p>
<p>As to what is meant by ‘collective’—any discrepancy between my representations and those of my fellow men raises a presumption of unreality and calls for explanation. If, however, the explanation is satisfactory; if, for instance, it turns out that the discrepancy was due, not to my hallucination, but to their myopia or their dullness, it is likely to be accepted; and then my representation may itself end by becoming collective.</p>
<p>It is, however, not necessary to maintain that collectivity is the <em>only</em> test for distinguishing between a representation and a collective representation (though, to creatures for whom insanity is round the corner, it is often likely to be the crucial one).</p>
<p>I am hit violently on the head and, in the same moment, perceive a bright light to be there. Later on I reflect that the light was ‘not really there’, even if I had lived all my life on a desert island where there was no-one to compare notes with, I might do as much. No doubt I should learn by experience to distinguish the first kind of light from the more practicable light of day or the thunderbolt, and should soon give up hitting myself on the head at sunset when I needed light to go on working by. In both cases I perceive light, but the various criteria of difference between them—duration, for instance, and a sharp physical pain, which the one involves and the other does not, are not difficult to apprehend.</p>
<p>What is required, is not to go on stressing the resemblance between collective representations and private representations, but to remember, when we leave the world of everyday for the discipline of any strict inquiry, that, <em>if</em> the particles, or the unrepresented, are in fact all that is <em>independently</em> there, then the world we all accept as real is in fact a system of collective representations.</p>
<p>Perception takes place by means of sense-organs, though the ingredient in it of sensation, experienced as such, varies greatly as between the different senses. In touch I suppose we come nearest to sensation without perception; in sight to perception without sensation. But the two most important things to remember about perception are these: <em>first</em>, that we must not confuse the percept with its cause. I do not hear undulating molecules of air; the name of what I hear is <em>sound</em>. I do not touch a moving system of waves or of atoms and electrons with relatively vast empty spaces between them; the name of what I touch is <em>matter</em>. <em>Second</em>, I do not perceive any <em>thing</em> with my sense-organs alone, but with a great part of my whole human being. Thus, I may say, loosely, that I ‘hear a thrush singing’. But in strict truth all that I ever merely ‘hear’—all that I ever hear simply by virtue of having ears—<em>is sound</em>. When ‘I hear a thrush singing’, I am hearing, not with my ears alone, but with all sorts of other things like mental habits, memory, imagination, feeling and (to the extent at least that the act of attention involves it) will. Of a man who merely heard in the first sense, it could meaningfully be said that ‘having ears’ (i.e., not being deaf) ‘he heard not’.</p>
<p>I do not think either of these two maxims depends on any particular theory of the nature of perception. They are true for any theory of perception I have ever heard of—with the possible exception of Bishop Berkeley’s. They are true, whether we accept the Aristotelian and medieval conception of form and matter, or the Kantian doctrine of the forms of perception, or the theory of specific sense-energy, or the ‘primary imagination’ of Coleridge, or the phenomenology that underlies Existentialism, or some wholly unphilosophical system of physiology and psychology. On almost any received theory of perception the familiar world—that is, the world which is apprehended, not through instruments and inference, but simply—is for the most part dependent upon the percipient.</p>
<h1 id="iii-figuration-and-thinking">III<br/>FIGURATION AND THINKING</h1>
<p>In the conversion of raindrops into a rainbow, or (if you prefer it) the production of a rainbow out of them, the eye plays a no less indispensable part than the sunlight—or than the drops themselves. In the same way, for the conversion of the unrepresented into a representation, at least one sentient organism is as much a <em>sine qua non</em> as the unrepresented itself; and for the conversion of the unrepresented into representations even remotely resembling our everyday world, at least one nervous system organized about a spinal cord culminating in a brain, is equally indispensable. The rainbow analogy does not imply, nor is it intended to suggest, that the solid globe is as insubstantial as a rainbow. The solid globe is solid. The rainbow is not. Only it is important to know what we mean by solidity. More than that, it is necessary to remember what we meant by solidity in one context, when we go on to use the word or think the thing in another.</p>
<p>It is easy to appreciate that there is no such thing as an unseen rainbow. It is not so easy to grasp that there is no such thing as an unheard noise. Or rather it is easy to grasp, but difficult to keep hold of. And this is still more the case, when we come to the sense of tough., Obvious as it may be to reflection that a system of waves or quanta or discrete particles is no more like solid matter than waves of air are like sound, or raindrops like a rainbow, it is not particularly easy to grasp, and it is almost impossible to keep in mind, that there is no such thing as unfelt solidity.¹ It is much more convenient, when we are listening for example to the geologist, to forget what we learnt about matter from the chemist and the physicist. But it really will not do. We cannot go on for ever having it both ways.</p>
<p>It may be expedient at this point to examine a little further the collective representations and our thinking about them. And it is clearly of little use to begin by asking what they are; since they are everything that is obvious. They are, for instance, the desk I am writing at, the noise of a door being opened downstairs, a Union Jack, an altar in a Church, the smell of coffee, a totem pole, the view from Malvern Hills, and the bit of brain-tissue that is being dissected before a group of students in a hospital laboratory. Some of them we can manipulate, as the lecturer is doing, and as I do when I move the desk. Some of them we cannot. What is important here is that there are, broadly speaking, three different things that we can do with all of them; or alternatively, they are related to the mind in three different ways.</p>
<p>First, we can simply contemplate or experience them—as when I simply look at the view, or encounter the smell. The whole impression appears then to be given to me in the representation itself. For I am not, or I am not very often, aware of smelling an unidentified smell and then thinking, ‘That is coffee!’ It appears to me, and appears instantly, that I smell coffee—though, in face, I can no more merely <em>smell</em> ‘coffee’ than I can merely <em>hear</em> ‘a thrush singing’. This immediate impression or experience of a familiar world has already been mentioned in Chapter II. It is important to be clear about it. It is plainly the result of an activity of some sort in me, however little I may recollect any such activity.</p>
<p>When a lady complained to Whistler that she did not see the world he painted, he is said to have replied: ‘No, ma’am, but don’t you wish you could?’ Both Whistler and the lady were really referring to that activity—which in Whistler’s case was intenser than the lady’s. Ought it to be called a ‘mental’ activity? Whatever it ought to be called, it really is the percipient’s own contribution to the representation. It is all <em>that</em> in the representation that is not sensation. For, as the organs of sense are required to convert the unrepresented (‘particles’) into sensations for us, so <em>something</em> is required in us to convert sensations into ‘things’. It is this something that I mean. And it will avoid confusion if I purposely choose an unfamiliar and little-used word and call it, at the risk of infelicity, <em>figuration</em>.</p>
<p>Now whether or no figuration is a mental activity, that is, a kind of thinking, it is clearly not, or it is not <em>characteristically</em>, a thinking <em>about</em>. The second thing, therefore, that we can do with the representations is to think about them. Here, as before, we remain unconscious of the intimate relation which they have, as representations, with our own organisms and minds. Or rather, more unconscious than before. For now our very attitude is, to treat them as independent of ourselves; to accept their ‘outness’ as self-evidently given; and to speculate about or to investigate their relations <em>with each other</em>. One could perhaps name this process ‘theorizing’ or ‘theoretical thinking’, since it is exactly what is done in most places where science is pursued, whether it be botany, medicine, metallurgy, zoology or any other. But I do not think the term is wide enough. The kind of thing I mean covers other studies as well—a good deal of history, for instance. Nor need it be systematic. There are very few children who do not do a little of it. Moreover, if a common word is chosen, there is the same danger of confusion arising from its occasional use with a less precise intention. Therefore, at the like hazard as before, I propose to call this particular kind of thinking <em>alpha-thinking</em>.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we can think about the <em>nature</em> of collective representations as such, and therefore about their relation to our own minds. We can think about perceiving and we can think about thinking. We can do, in fact, the kind of thinking which I am trying to do at the moment, and which you will be doing if you think I am right and also if you think I am wrong. This is part of the province of one or two sciences such as physiology and psychology, and of course it is also part of the province of philosophy. It has been called reflection or reflective thinking. But for the same reasons as before, I shall reject the simpler and more elegant term and call it <em>beta-thinking</em>.</p>
<p>It should be particularly noted that the distinction here made between alpha-thinking and beta-thinking is not one between two different <em>kinds</em> of thinking, such as for instance that which is sometimes made between analytical thinking on the one hand and synthetic or imaginative thinking on the other. It is purely a distinction of subject-matters.</p>
<p>The three operations—<em>figuration</em>, <em>alpha-thinking</em> and <em>beta-thinking</em>—are clearly distinguishable from one another; but that is not to say that they are divided by impassable barriers at the points where they mutually approach. Indeed the reverse is true. Moreover they may affect each other by reciprocal influence. In the history of the theory of colour, for instance, colour began by being regarded as a primary quality of the coloured object and was later transferred to the status of a ‘secondary’ quality dependent on the beholder. Here we can detect the interaction of alpha-thinking and beta-thinking; and again in the whole influence which experimental science has exerted on philosophy in the last two or three hundred years. This book, on the other hand, will be more concerned with the interaction between figuration and alpha-thinking.</p>
<p>That the former of these affects, and largely determines, the latter hardly needs saying; since the primary product of figuration is the actual subject-matter of most alpha-thinking. That the converse may sometimes also be true,k and further, that the borderline between the one and the other is sometimes quite impossible to determine—this is less obvious. Yet a little serious reflection (that is, a little beta-thinking) makes it apparent enough.</p>
<p>Recall for a moment the familiar jingle from <em>Sylvie and Bruno</em>, with its persistent refrain of ‘he thought he saw’ followed by ‘he found it was’:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>He thought he saw a Banker’s Clerk<br/>Descending from the bus,<br/>He looked again and found it was<br/>A hippopotamus.<br/>etc., etc.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is of course only a very improbable instance of an experience which, in itself, is quite common, especially with those among our representation (and they form the overwhelming majority) which reach us through the sense of sight alone. When we mistake one representation, that is to say one thing, for another, so that there is a transition from an ‘I thought I saw’ to an ‘I found it was’, it is often very difficult indeed to say whether there is first a figuration (based, let us say, on incomplete sensation) and then another and different figuration, producing a different representation; or whether there is one and the same representation veiled from us at first by some incorrect afpha-thinking which is subsequently discarded as inapplicable. In the particular case of a puzzled man trying to descry an object spotted far off at sea, it feels more like the latter. Often it feels much more like the former. We have made the mistake before we are aware of having done any thinking at all.</p>
<p>Anyone who wishes to investigate this further should attend carefully to the sort of mistakes we are apt to make on awaking abruptly from deep sleep in a darkened room; expecially if it happens to be a strange room. Either way we must conclude that figuration, whether or no it is a kind of thinking, is something which easily and imperceptibly passes over into thinking, and into which thinking easily and imperceptibly passes over. For in both cases there was a representation; otherwise I should not have been deceived. And if the first representation was the result of incorrect thinking, then thinking can do something very much like what figuration does. Alternatively, if it was the result of figuration alone, then the very fact of that figuration can ‘make a mistake’ suggests that it has a good deal in common with thinking.</p>

<p>¹’The thermometer is below freezing point, the pipe is cracked, and no water comes out of the tap. I know nothing about physics or chemistry; but surely I can say that there is solid ice in the pipe!’ Certainly you can; and if there was salt in the water, you can say that there is solid, <em>white</em> ice in the pipe. I am only pointing out that the solidity you are talking about involves your fancied touch, just as the whiteness involves your fancied glance. Only it is harder to remember.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="iv-participation">IV<br/>PARTICIPATION</h1>
<p>In the last few decades this whole question of the figurative make-up of collective representations and theoretical confusion between what I have called figuration and what I have called alpha-thinking has been implicitly raised by certain anthropologists. Putting it in a nutshell, they have suggested, by the whole manner of their approach to the workings of the ‘primitive’ mind, the question: Can there be such a thing as, ‘<em>They</em> thought <em>they</em> saw?’</p>
<p>Of course, two people can make the same momentary mistake about the identity of an imperfectly seen object. But, as we saw in Chapter II, the generally accepted criterion of the difference between ‘I thought I saw’ and ‘I found it was’ is, that the former is a private, the latter a collective representation. How, then, if the ‘they’ are a whole tribe or population? If the ‘mistake’ is not a momentary but a permanent one? If it is passed down for centuries from generation to generation? If, in fact, it is <em>never</em> followed by a ‘they found it was’? The difficulty is, that then the ‘mistake’ is itself a collective representation. And yet for ourselves, as we saw, it is precisely the collectivity of our representations which is the accepted test of their reality. It is this which convinces us that they are <em>not</em> mistakes or hallucinations. Why not then also for them—the primative tribe? But this is to go too fast.</p>
<p>The earlier anthropologists assumed as a matter of course that the primitive peoples who still survive in various parts of the earth perceive and think in the same <em>way</em> as we do—but that they think incorrectly. The assumption which underlies their whole approach to the subject is effectively epitomized in two sentences from Tylor’s <em>Primitive Culture</em>, first published in 1871:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was no spontaneous fancy but the reasonable inference that effects are due to causes, which led the rude men of olden days to people with such ethereal phantoms their own houses and haunts and the vast earth and sky beyond. Spirits are personified causes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This theory of an ‘inferring’ followed by a ‘peopling’, which is usually called ‘animism’, but which Durkheim prefers to call ‘naturism’, is moreover, according to Lévy-Bruhl, especially typical of the English school of anthropology, and he attributes this, rightly or wrongly, to the influence of Herbert Spencer, who assumed so readily that all things evolve from simple to complex. Be that as it may, the theory is attacked by the twentieth-century anthropologists to whom I have referred. They deny the ‘inferring’ and question the ‘peopling’. Lévy-Bruhl himself, for instance, insists, in the light of the evidence, that to ask how the primitive mind would ‘explain’ this or that natural phenomenon is a wrongly formulated question. The explanation is implied in the collective representations themselves. When we find a primitive mind incapable of grasping what is to us the self-evident law of contradiction, it is absurd to imagine such a mind thinking in terms of cause and effect, and of inference from the one to the other, Rather we are in contact with a different kind of thinking and a different kind of perceiving altogether. Lévy-Bruhl describes this ‘prelogical mentality’, which he says is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>essentially synthetic. By this I mean that the syntheses which compose it do not imply previous analyses of which the result has been registered in definite concepts, as is the case with those in which logical thought operates. In other words, the connecting links of the representations are given, as a rule, in the representations themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is also found to be a more satisfactory and convincing approach to the phenomenon of totemism, which involves the most inexplicable and, to us, nonsensical identifications and distinctions. To make no class-distinction between the sun and a white cockatoo, but to feel instantly and sharply a world of difference between both of these natural phenomena and a black cockatoo is, it is felt, a state of mind at which it would be difficult to arrive by inference. The elements which the totem-conscious mind selects out of the whole representation for <em>attention</em>, are often very very different from those which we select. Often, for instance, it is not much interested in the distinction between animate and inanimate (including artificial) objects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost everything that we see therein (i.e., in a being or object or natural phenomenon) escapes their attention or is a matter of indifference to them. On the other hand they see many things of which we are unconscious.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This leads Lévy-Bruhl to the conclusion that ‘Primatives see with eyes like ours, but they do not perceive with the same minds’. And he adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not correct to maintain, as is frequently done, that primitives associate occult powers, magic properties, a kind of soul or vital principle with all the objects which affect their senses or strike the imagination, and that their perceptions are surcharged with animistic beliefs. It is not a question of <em>association</em>. The mustic properties with which things are imbued form an integral part of the idea to the primitive who views it as a synthetic whole. It is at a later stage of social evolution that what we call a natural phenomenon tends to become the sole content of perceptions to the exclusion of other elements which then assume the aspect of beliefs, and finally appear superstitions. But as long as this ‘dissociation’ does not take place, perception remains an undifferentiated whole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may be questioned whether the epithet ‘mystic’, as it is used here, and in the expression ‘participation mystique’ which is especially associated with the name of Lévy-Bruhl, adds effectively to his meaning. Elsewhere he has defined the precise significance which he intends by it, and I shall revert to this shortly. What is important is the concept of participation. The principal reason which Lévy-Bruhl, Durkheim and others assign for the fact that primitives ‘do not perceive with the same minds’ as ours, is, that in the act of perception, they are not detached, as we are, from the representations. For us the only connection <em>of which we are conscious</em> is the external one through the senses. Not so for them. Thus, for Lévy-Bruhl:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The collective representations and interconnections which constitute such a (primitive) mentality are governed by the law of participation and in so far they take but little account of the law of contradiction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He speaks of ‘a veritable symbiosis . . . between the totemic group and its totem’ and tells us that, if we seek to penetrate their mental processes, ‘We must understand “the same” by virtue, not of the law of identity, but of the law of participation’.</p>
<p>Durkheim seeks to carry much further the bearing of anthropological inquiry on the origin and evolution of abstract thought. He affirms, for instance, that the identification of persons and individual phenomena with totems violates the principle of contradiction only as predications¹ does in our own thinking. The root or predecessor of predictions is to be found in ‘the use of totemic emblems by clans to express and communicate collective representations’.</p>
<p>We shall see that this same expression and communication are to-day the function of <em>language</em>. ‘Participation’ begins by being an activity, and essentially a communal or social activity. It takes place in rites and initiation ceremonies resulting in</p>
<blockquote>
<p>collective mental states of extreme emotional intensity, in which representation is as yet undifferentiated from the movements and actions which make the communion towards which it tends a reality to the group. Their participation in it is so effectively <em>lived</em> that it is not yet properly imagines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This stage is not only pre-logical, but also pre-mythical. It is anterior to collective representations themselves, as I have been using the term. Thus, the first development Durkheim traces is from symbiosis or active participation (where the individual feels he <em>is</em> the totem)² to collective representation of the totemic type (where the individual feels that his ancestors were the totem, that he will be when he dies, etc.). From this symbolic apprehension he then arrives at the duality, with which we are more familiar, of ideas on the one hand and numinous religion on the other.</p>
<p>This extra-sensory participation of the percipient in the representation involves a similar link between the representations themselves, and of course between one percipient and another. ‘Mana’ or ‘waken’ (which <em>we</em> can only translate by abstract terms like ‘totemic principle’, ‘life principle’ or—since it is present also in inanimate objests—’being’) is anterior to the individuality of persons and objects; these (says Durkheim) are rather apprehended by the very primitive as ‘stopping-places of mana’. It is, incidentally, here that he finds the prototype of the idea of <em>force</em>, which played such a prominent part in the physical science of the nineteenth century. And in emphasizing the ‘religious origin’ of this idea he points out, rather appositly, that Comte regarded the notion of force as a superstition, which was destined to disappear from science—as indeed ht has shown marked signs of doing, since Durkheim’s book was published.</p>
<p>I hope I have not misrepresented either of the two anthropologists from whom I have quoted rather freely. The more so, as I cannot pause to consider the adverse criticism which Lévy-Bruhl in particular has aroused. (I doubt if it was his case that all primitives <em>invariably</em> think in a prelogical way. It is certainly not mine.) If I have drawn heavily on these two writers, I have done so by way of illustration rather than argument. It is not very difficult to see what they mean and, by seeing what they mean, the reader may possibly be helped to see what <em>I</em> mean.</p>
<p>Collective representations do not imply a collective unity distinct from the individuals comprising the social group. On the other hand their existence does not derive from the individual. In these two respects they may be compared to language. Like the words of a language, they are common to the members of a given social group, and are transmitted from one generation to another, developing and changing only gradually in the process.</p>
<p>Moreover it is impossible to draw a very precise line between representations and beliefs about representations, or, in the terms I have been using, between figuration and alpha-thinking. All collective representations involve figuration and therefore, if figuration is a kind of thinking, involve ‘thought’. But in addition to this nearly all of them involve elements which are actually <em>apprehended</em> as thought, or imagined, rather than as perceived. It was this presumably which persuaded Lévy-Bruhl to add the word ‘mystic’ to his ‘participation’. He uses it, he says, ‘in the strictly defined sense in which “mystic” implies belief in forces and influences and actions, which though imperceptible to sense, are nevertheless real’.</p>
<p>When I see a stone fall to the ground, do I ‘believe’ that it is drawn by the force, or the law, of gravity? When I use the telephone, do I ‘believe’ that my correspondent’s voice is recorded and reproduced by an invisible called ‘electricity’? Or are both these thoughts immediately experienced in my representation? Or is one so and not the other? The exact point at which a piece of alpha-thinking has slipped into and become an integral part of the representation is hard to determine and may clearly differ somewhat between individuals of the same social group and for the same individual at different times. It is continually happening, while we are growing up, especially while we are learning to speak. I say I ‘hear a thrush singing outside my window’. But do I? He is invisible, and it might perhaps be a blackbird; I have begun the business of thinking and believing already! The same thing happens to a lifelong birdwatcher. He does no thinking at all. He <em>recognizes</em>. He hears a thrush singing. For him alpha-thinking has become figuration.</p>
<p>To sum up what has been said in this chapter: Anthropology began by assuming as a matter of course that primative peoples perceive the same phenomena as we do and on that assumption investigated their beliefs about those phenomens. Now however some anthropologists have begun to point out that the difference between the primitive outlook and ours begins at an earlier stage. It is not only a different alpha-thinking but a different figuration, with which we have to do, and therefore the phenomena are treatedas collective representations produced by that different figuration. It is further maintained by some of them that the most striking difference between primitive figuration and ours is, that the primitive involves ‘participation’; that is, an awareness which we no longer have, of an extra-sensory link between the percipient and the representation. This involves, not only that we think differently, but that the phenomena (collective representation) themselves are different. The first three chapters were devoted to reminding the reader that we do, in fact, still participate in the phenomena, though for the most part we do so unconsciously. <em>We</em> can only remind ourselves of that participation by beta-thinking and we forget it again as soon as we leave off. This is the fundamental difference, not only between their thinking and ours, but also between their phenomena and ours. It remains to consider how ours, which are genetically the later, have come to pass.</p>

<p>²Anyone who finds it difficult to form any conception of participation, that is, of self and not-self identified in the same moment of experience, should reflect on that whole peculiar realm of semi-subjectivity which still leads a precarious existence under the name of ‘instinct’—or on those ‘irresistable’ impulses, on which psychiatrists are inclined to dwell. Many of us know what panic feels like, and ordinary men are proud of their sexual vigour or ashamed of the lack of it, although the act is readily acknowledged in retrospect to be at least as much something that is done to, or with, them by an invisible force of nature, as something they themselves veritably <em>do</em>.</p>

<h1 id="v-pre-history">V<br/>PRE-HISTORY</h1>
<p>A history of the ‘world’, as distinct from a history of the unrepresented, must clearly be a history of phenomena; that is, of collective representation. But before this part of the subject is approached, it will be well to consider briefly the bearing of this truth on what is sometimes called pre-history. I mean, in particular, the history of the earth before the appearance on it of human beings.</p>
<p>When particles of rain, rays of light and our watching eyes are appropriately disposed, we see a rainbow. In the same way, given the existence of the particles and the presence of human beings on the earth, there arise collective representations, or in other words the phenomena which we call ‘nature’. When dealing with times in which these conditions were present, therefore, it is quite reasonable to describe and investigate nature scientifically, not only in the manner of physics, but also in the manner of the sciences whose field of study is the past as well as the present, such as geology, ecology, zoology, and to do this <em>as if</em> the phenomena were wholly independent of man’s sensory and psychological participation. It is not necessarily misleading to do so, and it has proved to be of great practical use. It is however not sufficiently realized that different considerations apply to nay description, in familiar terms, of natural events and processes deemed to have taken place before the appearance of human life on the earth.</p>
<p>It may of course be contended (though I should not like the task) that some animals enjoy representations sufficiently coherent to set up a phenomenal whole, which could be called ‘a world’ or ‘nature’. But this does not really assist much. For, although animals appeared on earth before man, it is certainly not <em>their</em> world or nature which geology, for instance, describes; and even so there remains the whole vast panorama of pre-hostory which is assumed to have preceded the emergence on this planet of sentient life of any description.</p>
<p>Yet by combining, say, biology and geology and omitting physics and physiology, such descriptions are continually offered to us and form, I suppose, a recognized part of the education of most children to-day. It can do no harm to recall occasionally that the prehistoric evolution of the earth, as it is described for example in the early chapters of H. G. Wells’s <em>Outline of History</em>, was not merely never seen. It never occurred. Something no doubt occurred, and what is really being propounded by such popular writers, and, so far as I am aware, by the text-books on which they rely, is this. That at that time the unrepresented was behaving in such a way that, <em>if</em> human beings with the collective representations characteristic of the last few centuries of western civilization had been there, the things described whould also have been there.</p>
<p>This is not quite the same thing. It needs, I should have thought, to be considered in connection with another fact, namely, that wehn attention is <em>expressly</em> directed to the history of the unrepresented (as in calculations of the age of the earth based on radio-activity), it is invariably assumed that the behaviour of the unrepresented has remained fundamentally unchanged. Moreover (and this is, to my mind, more important), for those hypothetical ‘human beings with collective representations characteristic of the last few centuries of western civilization’ we might choose to substitute other human beings—those, for instance, who lived one or two or three or more thousand years ago. We should then have to write a different pre-history altogether. And we are not entitled to assume without inquiry that, as an indirect means of suggesting the truth about pre-historic boings-on in the unrepresented, such an alternative ‘model’ would be any less efficient than the one we have in fact chosen. It might be very much more so.</p>
<p>As these consequences may be startling enough to the reader to cause him to reject them, even though he has so far followed me with tympathy, I will, at the risk of repeating myself, put as clearly as I can the alternatives to accepting them. If we refuse to accept them, we can adopt one of three courses, to each of which there are, to me, insuperable objections. We can adopt a sort of super-naîve realism, rejecting all the rigmarole of physics, physiology and psychology with the healthy instinct of Dr. Johnson kicking his stone. ‘Nature is nature, and the earth is the earth, and always has been since it all began.’ This may do for the present moment, but for a scientifically reconstructed prehistoric past it is open to the objection that, if we are going to reject the reasoned inferences of one set of scientists, there seems no particular reason why we should accept those of another. Or we can resort frankly to ‘double-think’. We can think that what physics tells us is true, is true when we are studying physics, and untrue when we are studying something else. The objections to this course are obvious to me, and will be equally so to some of my readers. There are those who will nevertheless continue to adopt it. This book is addressed to the others. Lastly we can adopt a Berkeleyan view of phenomena. For Berkeley held that, not merely the unrepresented, but the representations <em>as such</em>, are sustained by God in the absence of human beings. This involves the, for me, too difficult corollary that, out of all the wide variety of collective representations which are found even to-day over the face of the earth, and the still wider variety which history unrolls before us, God has chosen for His delight the particular set shared by Western man in the last few centuries.</p>
<p>It does not of course necessarily follow that all the current descriptions of pre-history are absurd. Even if the usual way of recording what, in the absence of man, was going on in the unrepresented must be criticised as a dubious extrapolation, the descriptions may still, as I have suggested, but valuable, not as actual descriptions, but as notional ‘models’. What is important is, to remember that that is all they are. (Especially will this be the case, if we should ever have to assess the merits of this approach against those of any other possible way of acquiring knowledge of the pre-historic past.) For their nature is that of artificial imagery. And when the nature and limitations of artificial images are forgotten, they become idols. Francis Bacon declared that the medieval approach to reality was under the spell of four different sorts of idols, which he called ‘idols of the cave’, ‘idols of the tribe’ and so forth. In the same way, these images of what was going on in the unrepresented in the pre-historic past may be called ‘idols of the study’. At least that is what they are, if their nature and limitations are forgotten. And I am not sure that as yet these have even been <em>noticed</em>.</p>
<p>It is, however, not only these purely theoretical or academic idols with which this book is concerned.</p>
<h1 id="vi-original-participation">VI<br/>ORIGINAL PARTICIPATION</h1>
<p>It is characteristic of our phenomena—indeed it is this, above all, which distinguishes them from those of the past—that our participation in them, and therefore also their representational nature, is excluded from our immediate awareness. It is consequently always ignored by our ‘common sense’ and sometimes denied even in theory. For this reason it will be best to begin the brief series of observations which I want to make upon the history of phenomena—that is, the history of the familiar world—from the present day, and to work backwards from there to the remoter past. Our first step, then, is to trace the last stage of this development, which has led up to the collective representation with which we are familiar to-day.</p>
<p>Participation is the extra-sensory relation between man and the phenomena. It was shown in Chapter III that the existence of phenomena depends on it. Actual participation is therefore as much a fact in our case as in that of primitive man. But we have also seen that we are unaware, whereas the primitive mind is aware of it. This primitive awareness, however, is obviously not the theoretical kind which <em>we</em> can still arrive at by beta-thinking. For that presupposes some acquaintance with the findings of modern physics and physiology and can only be applied to the kind of collective representations that go with this. The primitive kind of participation is indeed not theoretical at all, inasmuch as it is given in immediate experience. Let us distinguish it from ours by calling it ‘original’ participation. It would however be cumbersome to add the epithet every time the word is used and I propose very often to omit it, having first made it plain here and now that by ‘participation’ I shall mean <em>original participation</em>, unless the context otherwise requires.</p>
<p>There is another difference between sophisticated and primitive participation. Hitherto we have spoken of <em>representations</em> and of the <em>unrepresented</em>; but we have said nothing of any ‘represented’. This raises the question whether <em>representation</em> was the proper word to use at all, or whether it is merely misleading. If an appearance can properly be called a representation, it will certainly be a representation <em>of</em> something. Just as ‘the particles’, then (the name here chosen for all that is conceived to exist <em>independently</em> of consciousness), have also been called the <em>unrepresented</em>, so, whatever is <em>correlative</em> to the appearances or representations will here be called the <em>represented</em>. This is of course a mere name, and gives as yet no clue to the nature of what is meant. I hope that further light will be thrown upon it, gradually, as we proceed. Meanwhile I must use the name, leaving the reader to make up his mind, ambulando, whether it was justified or not.</p>
<p>We have seen that a very large part of the collective representations is found by beta-thinking to have been contributed by the percipient’s own activity. Beta-thinking therefore inevitably assumes that a very large part of their correlative, the <em>represented</em>, is to be found ‘within’ ourselves. Consequently if <em>our</em> participation, having been first understood and accepted, by beta-thinking, as a fact, should then become a conscious experience, it would have to take the form of conscious (instead of, as now, unconscious) figuration. This is because for us, the represented is conceived as within our percipient selves; and it is only an unrepresented physical base (‘particles’) which we conceive of as without. Not so for primitives. For them the represented, too, is conceived as outside, so that there is no question of conscious figuration. It may also sometimes be detected within, but it is detected primarily without. The human soul may be one of the ‘stopping places’ for <em>mana</em>, but what differentiates the primitive mind from ours is, that it conceives itself to be only <em>one</em> of those stopping-places and not necessarily the most significant. The essence of <em>original</em> participation is that there stands behind the phenomena, <em>and on the other side of them from me</em>, a represented which is of the same nature as me. Whether it is called ‘mana’, or by the names of many gods and demons, or God the Father, or the spirit world, it is of the same nature as the perceiving self, inasmuch as it is not mechanical or accidental, but psychic and voluntary.</p>
<p>I have here assumed that what Lévy-Bruhl and Durkheim and their followers say about contemporary primitive man is substantially correct; and it seems to me likely to be so.¹ But whether or not it is correct for contemporary primitive man, it is certainly true of historically early man. All the evidence from etymology and elsewhere goes to show that the further back we penetrate into the past of human consciousness, the more mythical in their nature do the representations become. Moreover there is no evidence to the contrary. I shall say something later on of the testimony borne by etymology. Here it must suffice to affirm categorically that, for the nineteenth-century fantasy of early man first gazing, with his mind <em>tabula rasa</em>, at natural phenomena like ours, then seeking to explain them with thoughts like ours, and then by a process of inference ‘peopling’ them with the ‘aery phantoms’ of mythology, there just is not any single shred of evidence whatever.</p>
<p>I do not mean, by using the word ‘fantasy’, to imply contempt. If great scholars like Max M¨ller and Sir James Frazer, in seeking for the historical origins of myth, made the same mistake as the early anthropologists, it will, I hope, become apparent in the course of this and the ensuing chapters how inevitable it was that they should do so. To-day, on the other hand, partly thanks to their work, any little man, provided he is not hopelessly prejudiced, can convince himself of the contrary. The point is, not to find someone to turn up our noses at, but to grasp that fact that alpha-thinking, when men first began to exercise it, had to be directed upon <em>that</em> kind of collective representation (namely the participated kind) and not on collective representations resembling ours, which (as we shall see) are a later product of that very alpha-thinking.</p>
<p>For alpha-thinking, as I have defined it, is a thinking <em>about</em> collective representations. But when we think ‘about’ anything, we must necessarily be aware of ourselves (that is, of the self which is doing the thinking) as sharply and clearly detached from the thing thought about. It follows that alpha-thinking involves <em>pro tanto</em> absence of participation. It is in fact the very nature and aim of pure alpha-thinking to exclude participation. When, therefore, it is directed, as it hast to be to start with, on phenomena determined by original participation, then, at first simply by being alpha-thinking, and at a later stage deliberately, it seeks to destroy that participation. The more so because (as we shall also see), participation renders the phenomena less predictable and less calculable.</p>
<p>The history of alpha-thinking accordingly includes the history of science, as the term has hitherto been understood, and reaches its culmination in a system of thought which only interests itself in phenomena to the extent that they can be grasped as independent of consciousness. This culmination appears to have been reached about the close of the nineteenth century. For, along with the recent tendency of physics to implicate the observer again in the phenomena, there goes the tendency of physicists to give up alpha-thinking about phenomena and occupy themselves, as mathmeticians, only with the unrepresented.</p>
<p>Systematic alpha-thinking appears to have begun with astronomy. Whether this was because the movements of the heavenly bodies display a regularity which is mostly lacking in sublunary phenomena, and which would be the first therefore to attract the attention of minds beginning for the first time to interest themselves in regularity, or whether it was for some other reason, we need not consider. Astronomy is generally regarded as the <em>doyen</em> of the sciences, and a glance at its history from Greek times to the present day or thereabouts will afford some insight into the development of that exact thinking about phenomena which is called science and the effect of that development on the collective representations of Western man. I say from Greek times because, although the Egyptians and Chaldeans appear to have kept astronomical records over a very long period, we know nothing of any avowedly <em>speculative</em> thought earlier than the Greeks either on this or on any other subject.</p>
<p>That the collective representations to which this speculative thought was applied were of the kind already indicated, i.e., participated, is obvious enough. Apart from speculative thought, it would never have occurred to an ancient Greek to doubt that the heavenly bodies and their spheres were in one way or another representations of divine beings. Such doubt was, in fact, voiced occasionally—simply because the Greek mind was of such an incorrigibly speculative nature that there was very little that did <em>not</em> occur to it—as a purely notional possibility. But the point is that, in the early days of alpha-thinking, any such notion was a secondary speculation, and rather a wild one, about collective representations whose character made the contrary, ‘representational’, view seem the obvious one.</p>
<p>The systematic alpha-thinking exercised only by the thoughtful few is applied to the phenomena, that is, to collective representations which they share with the many. And we are left in no doubt by Plato’s Dialogues, and by the whole language and literature of Greece, what these, in general, were like. There it was the materialist who looked like a Berkeley and the Greek equivalent of Dr. Johnson whoud return from speculation to common sense, not by kicking a stone, but by appealing to collective representations made obvious by his upbringing, by the language he spoke and heard spoken all around him, and by the active cults which were his daily matter of fact experience. Even the atoms of Democritus were, of course, not atoms, as the word has been understood in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. They were imagined as components of mind no less than of matter. In other words they were the only sort of atoms which alpha-thinking about participated phenomena <em>could</em> present to itself for the purpose of speculation.</p>
<p>It is in this light that we must approach, if we wish to understand them, not only the speculations of Plato, and Aristotle, for instance, on the nature of the stars and planets, but also the meanings of common words like <em>νους</em> (<em>nous</em>) and <em>λογος</em> (<em>logos</em>), and the whole apparatus of language by which they expressed these speculations. If we are content to translate, and to <em>think</em> ‘mind’ for <em>νους</em> and ‘reason’ or ‘word’ for <em>λογος</em>, we are in continual danger of surreptitiously substitution our own phenomena for those which they were in fact dealing with. It is not only that they speculated on whether the planets were ‘visible gods’ or only images of the gods, as statues are; on the nature of the Fifth Essence and its relation to the earthly elements; on the Anima Mundi; on whether or not the Aether, which is the substance of the spheres, has a soul, etc. The very meanings of the incidental words with the help of which they did the speculating, implied participation <em>of some sort</em>. Whereas the words into which we struggle to translate them imply the reverse. Some examples of these words will be considered in a later chapter, when it will be seen that original participation survived in an attenuated form even into the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>It may remove the risk of misunderstanding if I mention at this early stage that it is no part of the object of this book to advocate a return to original participation.</p>

<h1 id="vii-appearance-and-hypothesis">VII<br/>APPEARANCE AND HYPOTHESIS</h1>
<p>According to Plato there were three stages, or degrees of knowledge. The first and lowest amounted to no more than observation. Since all that we perceive is continually changing, coming into being and passing away, this kind of ‘knowledge’ grasps nothing permanent and nothing therefore which can properly be called ‘truth’. At the opposite pole, the highest degree—which is the only one that can <em>properly</em> be called knowledge—is wholly extra-sensory. It is the contemplation by pure intelligence of the divine ideas, and above all of the Supreme Good. The union of these two, that is, of pure intelligence and sense-knowledge, gives rise to an intermediate mental activity, which Plato stigmatized as ‘bastard’—although he insisted on all his pupils studying it as a preparation and a means to the true knowledge. This intermediate activity was geometry; or, as we should now say, mathematics.</p>
<p>These three degrees of knowledge correspond with three different levels of astronomy. The astronomy of observation merely records the movements of the stars, the sun, the moon and the planets, without attempting to account for them or reduce them to any system. From this we can rise to the second astronomy, which seeks to account for the apparently arbitrary movement of, for instance, the planets by supposing regular geometrical patterns to underlie them. By the exercise of this celestial geometry we can render ourselves capable of rising eventually to the third and highest, that is, to the only true knowledge; which is an unobscured participation in the divine Mind, or Word, itself. The real wisdom, as distinct from its not wholly unworthy outcome in the permanent truths of geometry, manifests itself only to him who participates in however slight a degree in the pure and divine Intelligence. This intelligent participation, the privilege of philosophy and in the last resort of initiation, was not mystical. For mystical experience is essentially other than ordinary experience. But the Platonic or Aristotelian participation, which was true knowledge, was simply the half-conscious participation of every man (the participation by virtue of which he <em>was</em> a man) cleared of the gross and bewildering mutability which is plastered over it by the other approaqch, through the senses.</p>
<p>Plato further laid it down orally, as we learn from later astronomers, that the science of astronomy proper lay within the middle one of these three spheres of knowledge. In the first place the ‘phaenomena’, or ‘appearances’, that is the apparent movements of the heavenly bodies, could be watched by observation. In the third place the true knowledge, since it was acquainted with the divine spirits who ensouled or guided the heavenly bodies, had already laid down certain fundamental principles. Later on, I shall say something of the ‘mental-spatial’ experience chich claimed to determine the nature of movement out of the nature of pure thought. It appears as a mere confusion to the alpha-thinking of today (although that, too, is beginning to talk without appreciable discomfort of ‘space-time’). Here it must suffice to record that the prescribed movements were, among other requirements, perfect circles at a constant speed.</p>
<p>There is perhaps more of physics than of astronomy in Aristotle’s <em>De Caelo</em>, but, as far as the three stages of knowledge and the fundamental principles just referred to are concerned, he was substantially in accord with Plato.</p>
<p>The ‘phenomena’ of which the astronomy of Greece and of the dark and middle ages spoke, were of course not quite what we to-day mean by ‘phenomena’, a word which, outside philosophy, has come to be practically sysnonymous with ‘objects’ and ‘events’. The middle voice of the Greek verb suggests neigher wholly ‘what is perceived, from within themselves, by men’ nor wholly ‘what, from without, forces itself on man’s senses’, but something between the two. This is also fairly suggested by the English word ‘appearances’, which is generally used in translating the once hard-worked phrase <em>σωξειν τα φαινομενα</em>—‘to save the appearances’. This phrase, used by Simplicius in his sixth century <em>Commentary</em> on Aristotle’s <em>De Caelo</em>, continued to dominate astronomy down to the time of Copernicus.</p>
<p>When we hear of ‘saving appearances’ to-day, we are apt to think of a society hostess at a dinner party where something has gone wrong in the kitchen. It was not so in the seventeenth century. Although he spoke of God’s laughter, Milton was not <em>himself</em> laughing at the astronomers when he wrote in the Eighth book of <em>Paradise Lost</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Or if they list to try<br/>Conjecture, he his fabric of the heavens<br/>Hath left to their disputes, perhaps to move<br/>His laughter at their quaint opinions wide<br/>Hereafter, when they come to model heaven,<br/>And calculate the stars; how they will wield<br/>The mighty frame; how build, unbuild, contrive,<br/>To save appearances; how gird the sphere<br/>With centric and eccentric scribbled o’er,<br/>Cycle and epicycle, orb in orb.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor was he suggesting that desperate expedients were being resorted to, in order to ‘save’ (in the sense of rescuing) the Ptolemaic system—which, incidentally, he had made the framework of his own poem. He was introducing a learned <em>cliché</em>.</p>
<p>The same passage from Simplicius contains the Greek verb from which we derive the word ‘hypothesis’. The spheres and orbits by which the appearances were to be saved were normally ‘hypotheses’ in the strict sense of the word, that is, assumptions made for the purpose of a particular argument and by the same token not posited as true. A brief digression on the almost lost distinction between the word ‘hypothesis’ and the word ‘theory’ may not be amiss here. The Greek word <em>θεωρια</em> (theoria) meant ‘contemplation’ and is the term used in Aristotle’s psychology to designate the moment of fully conscious participation, in which the soul’d <em>potential</em> knowledge (its ordinary state) becomes <em>actual</em>, so that man can at last claim to be ‘awake’. This is no guide to its present, or even recent meaning, but it does emphasize the difference between a proposition which it is hoped may turn out to be true, and a proposition, the truth or untruth of which is irrelevant. The geometrical paths and movements devised for the planets were, in the minds of those who invented them, <em>hypotheses</em> in the latter sense. They were arrangements—devices—for saving the appearances; and the Greek and medieval astronomers were not at all disturbed by the fact that the same appearances could be saved by two or more quite differenet hypotheses, such as an eccentric or an epicycle or, particularly in the case of Venus and Mercury, by supposed revolution round the earth or supposed revolution round the sun. All that mattered was, which was the simplest and the most convenient for practical purposes; for neither of them had any essential part in truth or knowledge.</p>
<p>Unless we realize, with the help of a little historical excavation of this kind, what from the epistemological point of view astronomy then signified and had signified for about two thousand years, we shall not understand the real signicance of Copernicus and Galileo. The popular view is, that Copernicus ‘discovered’ that the earth moves round the sun. Actually the <em>hypothesis</em> that the earth revolves round the sun is at least as old as the third century B.C., when it was advanced by Aristarchus of Samos, and he was neither the only, nor probably the first astronomer to think of it. Copernicus himself knew this. Secondly it is generally believed that the Church tried to keep the discovery dark. Actually Copernicus did not himself want to publish his <em>De Revoolutionibus Orbium</em>, and was only eventually prevailed on to do so by the importunity of two eminent Churchmen.</p>
<p>The real turning-point in the history of astronomy and of science in general was something else altogether. It took place when Copernicus (probably—it cannot be regarded as certain) began to think, and others, like Kepler and Galileo, began to affirm that the heliocentric hypothesis not only saved the appearances, but was physically true. It was this, this novel idea that the Copernican (and therefore any other) hypothesis might not be a hypothesis at all but the ultimate truth, that was almost enough in itself to constitute the ‘scientific revolution’, of which Professor Butterfield has written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it outshines everything since the rise of Christianity and reduces the Renaissance and Reformation to the rank of mere episodes, mere internal displacements, within the system of medieval Christendom.¹</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the ordinary man hears that the Church told Galileo that he might teach Copernicanism as a hypothesis which saved all the celestial phenomena satisfactorily, but ‘not as being the truth’, he laughs. But this was really how Ptolemaic astronomy had been taught! In its actual place in history it was not a casuistical quibble; it was the refusal (unjustified it may be) to allow the introduction of a new and momentous doctrine. It was not simply a new theory of the nature of the celestial movements that was feared, but a new theory of the nature of theory; namely, that, if a hypothesis saves all the appearances, it is identical with truth.² them the last traces of original participation. In doing so he has produced the mechanomorphic collective representations which constitute the Western World today.</p>

<p>We have just distinguished between the actual doctrines of modern science and the collective representation to which the growth of science has contributed. Thus, on the one hand attention may be directed to the history of alpha-thinking itself—what is ordinarily called the history of thought or the history of ideas. On the other hand it may be turned to the <em>effects</em> of an alpha-thinking which has continued long and widely enough to pass over into figuration, and be, as it were, smitten into the representations themselves; that is part of the history of <em>consciousness</em>, and of the collective representations which are its correlative. Now although my subject is not the doctrines of science, but rather the collective representations, which have been so deeply affected by the doctrines of science, it may be well to pause here for a moment and consider the relation of scientific theories to truth and knowledge.</p>
<p>What is the view taken by scientists themselves of that relation? The answer is not very clear. And it is a good deal less clear to-day than it was a generation ago. The limited scope of all scientific inquiry is to-day often emphasized rather strongly by those engaged in it. So much so, that when we have heard them on the subject, we are sometimes left with the feeling that we ought to look on all scientific theories as mere ‘hypotheses’ in the sense of the Platonic and medieval astronomers, and that it is wrong to take any of them with the ‘liberalness’ that embroiled Galileo with the Church. They are at best, we are assured, the mathematical formulae which up to the time of writing have been found the simplest and most convenient for—well, for saving the appearances. In physics in particular there is a marked tendency to treat almost as an <em>enfant terrible</em> anyone who takes the models literally enough to refer to them in any context outside that of physical inquiry itself.¹ It would seem to follow from this that, as Plato and the astronomers believed, scientific hypotheses have no direct relation to the real nature of things.</p>
<p>On the other hand I find something equivocal in the public utterances of the spokesmen of science. For the same ones who have just been stressing this unpretentious view of scientific theory will frequently let drop some such phrase as ‘some day we may know’—or even ‘we now know’—when speaking, not of some particular hypothesis, but of quite general conclusions about the nature of universe, earth, or man. Moreover, if the occasion is a formal one, we often get some reference to the history of science, in terms of ‘advancing the frontiers of knowledge’, and so forth. All this indicates a very different conception of science and strongly suggests to the audience that modern science, so far from being disentitled to claim the status of knowledge, is the only reliable knowledge available to us. At the least, it suggests that the findings of any particular science are not merely tools for the application and further pursuit of that science, but have some sort of absolute validity.</p>
<p>Perhaps the confusion is at present unavoidable, but let us at least be clear that it <em>is</em> a confusion between two quite incompatible views. Let us see, for instance, what consequences flow from adopting the first view, namely, that scientific theories are simply hypotheses to save the appearances. This can best be done with the help of a qrotesquely over-simplified analogy. But first let me make the bearing of the analogy clear. It will contrast two different sorts of ‘knowledge’, both of which, <em>in the analogy</em>, depend on alpha-thinking; but it will <em>illustrate</em> the difference between a ‘knowledge’ which does depend on alpha-thinking and a different kind of knowledge altogether which does not. Plato and Aristotle, and others, as we have seen, taught that there was such a knowledge and that it was accessible only to participation. But it is not necessary to believe this in order to understand the analogy.</p>
<p>Take a clever boy, who knows nothing about the principle of internal combustion or the inside of an engine, and leave him inside a motor-car, first telling him to move the various knobs, switches and levers about and see what happens. If no disaster supervenes, he will end by finding himself able to drive the car. It will then be true to say that he knows <em>how to drive</em> the car; but untrue to say that he knows the car. As to that, the most we could say would be that he has an ‘operative’ knowledge of it—because for operation all that is required is a good empirical acquaintance with the dashboard and the pedals. Whatever we say, it is obvious that what he has is very different from the knowledge of someone else, who has studied mechanics, internal combustion and the construction of motor-cars, though he has perhaps never driven a car in his life, and is perhaps too nervous to try. Now whether or no there is another kind of knowledge of nature, which corresponds to ‘engine-knowledge’ in the analogy, it seems that, <em>if the first view of the nature of scientific theory is accepted</em>, the kind of knowledge aimed at by science must be, in effect, what I will call ‘dashboard-knowledge’.</p>
<p>Francis Bacon, whose startlingly original mind was so influential in bringing about the scientific revolution, was very frank about this. Not only did he maintain that knowledge was to be valued for the <em>power</em> it gives man over nature; but he practically made success in this aim a part of his definition of knowledge. The key words he uses to distinguish the knowledge he exalts from the knowledge pursued by the Schoomen are ‘fruit’ and ‘operation’. In other words, not only ‘science’ but knowledge itself, that is, the only knowledge that is not mere trifling, is, for him—technology. Knowledge (for which Bacon, when he wrote in Latin, of course used the word <em>scientia</em>) is that which enables us to make nature do our bidding.</p>
<p>I think it must be acknowledged that the ‘idea’ which stands behind the particular kind of knowledge which we have come to call ‘science’ is ‘dashboard-knowledge’. I mean only that that is its <em>mode</em> of ‘knowing’. I do not of course mean that the motive by which the great scientists have been inspired has been the desire for power. The analogy is admittedly a crude one. For, while the dashboard of even the most expensive and up-to-date car is a comparatively simple affair, nature’s ‘dashboard’—that is, her exterior, accessible to the senses and the reason—is of such a marvellous and intricate complexity that many a man has counted his life well spent in mastering a tiny corner of it.</p>
<p>If however it <em>is</em> acknowledged, what follows? If science is merely technology, if the theories of physics in particular are mere hypotheses to save the appearances, with no necessary relation to ultimate truth, then—well, in the first place, one hopes that the car will not break down. But, in the second place, it might be argued that they should be consistently treated as such. It might be said that the theories of physics should be reserved for the purposes of physics and left out of sight altogether, when we are thinking about anything else—about the nature of perception, for instance. This would remove the foundation from under the first part of this book. But it would also have so many other, and such startling consequences, that I am not seriously alarmed.</p>
<p>For, in the first place, we could not limit the new and more hypothetical of thinking to nuclear, or recent physics. The laws of gravity, for example, and of intertia, must go the same way as the electrons, as far as any ultimate validity is concerned. Secondly, you cannot really isolate one science from others in this way, nor is it the practice to do so. One has only to think of the effects of physical theory, treated as fact, on the sciences of medicine and astronomy as exemplified in radio-therapy and astrophysics. Thirdly, and most important of all for my purposes, the hypotheses do in fact, get into the collective representations; many of them are, and others soon may be, implicit in the very ‘nature’ which surrounds us, and therefore in the world in which I have to write. And lastly the withdrawal from ‘participation’, which alpha-thinking has brought about, has its advantages. The vagaries of confusion and savagery in the tribes in which anthropology finds participation most conspicuously surviving to-day, though they may well not be very reliable guides to its ancient quality among other peoples who have long since abandoned it, do nevertheless remind us of the sins of commission in thought, feeling and action of which original participation is capable. Whatever sins of omission alpha-thinking may be guilty of, we owe to it, up to now, our independence, much of our security, our psychological integrity and perhaps our very existence as individuals. When Prospero renounced his last enchantments and set sail for civilization, Ariel, it is true, remained with Caliban—but so did Setebos.</p>

<p>It is the common opinion that, whereas we see nature pretty much as she really is, primitive man sees and archaic or early man saw her all awry through the veil of a complicated system of fancies and beliefs.</p>

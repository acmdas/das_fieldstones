<p>Sat, 21 Jan 2017</p>
<p>There was a time, years ago, when there were fairly frequent, short posts here, mostly of the TOTD (Thought of the Day) variety—pithy sayings, sentences or paragraphs gleaned from the day’s Internet prowling or the evening’s reading. Then the day came when I realized that, for the most part, those pithy sayings tended to be, well, possibly impolitic given the nature of my business arrangements (my primary client being the Federal Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, or CSAT, in essence not only Federal bureaucrats but almost entirely social workers). So, like a prudent if not courageous undercover something-or-other not at all progressive or even liberal (unless maybe Classical Liberal), I censored myself. Or, as Archie Bunker would say, “Stifle yerself!”</p>
<p>So, enough deep background. I see that I told this story in more detail just a few months ago <a href="http://www.consultingsmiths.com/why-add-to-a-blog-in-2016/## more-428" target="_blank">here</a> so have a look if you’re interested. Today’s point, and I do have one, is that FaceBook and I are having a partial parting of the ways. And this is to tell why.</p>
<p>First, the parting is partial because FB is still the only place to keep up with Grandkids and Great-Grandkids, particularly the ones in British Columbia. And other folks I give a damn about. So, I’ll be checking in off and on, liking and saying nice things about other folks posts now and then. Just trying to not see too much and saying as little as I can. It’s just too depressing—the alternative reality that a lot of my friends and family are living in isn’t somewhere I want to visit.</p>
<p>So, to wrap this one up, I just might be putting stuff of interest, and even the occasional output from my fevered brain, here. We’ll see.</p>
<h2 id="twitter-and-me-and-very-strange-business-decisions">Twitter and Me and Very Strange Business Decisions</h2>
<p>Sat, 21 Jan 2017</p>
<p>I had a Twitter account very early on. It’s deleted now, and all the related emails that I’ve gotten from Twitter, so I’m not sure exactly when, but sometime in 2008. I “tweeted” maybe twice or three times before this summer, then I discovered <a href="http://thestrobist.com">The Strobist</a> site and got excited about moving beyond “available light” photography. The Strobist has an amazing amount of information, including detailed tutorials, on using off-camera flash. Great resource, strongly recommended, but this is about Twitter. Sort of.</p>
<p>David Hobby, aka “The Strobist”, decided some time ago to disable comments and move all communications with his viewers to Twitter, so I got on board to thank him for his generosity, and to ask a few questions. He responded generously and quickly every time, and all was right with the world. Since I’m not an habitual Tweeter (twitterer?) that was it until last week, when I got Yet Another weekly email from Twitter telling me how much I was missing by not logging in and tweeting. It was a slow day (they almost all are now) and David and Joe McNally and some other folks whose names I didn’t recognize were bemoaning the demise of everything good an bright in the world as we know it, or as we knew it, or something like that. And scrolling back, it had been like that pretty much since the election (yes, That election). Like on Facebook. Except I don’t get any pictures of my Great Grandsons on Twitter. So I shit-canned it. Nuked from orbit. Over after all these years.</p>
<p>And, I do get that lots of folks really do believe the kinds of things that they’re saying, that it’s the attack of the Nazi Zombies from Mars or something and the end of all the goodness and sweetness from life. I get that, although I can’t comprehend how they get there, or seriously believe that it’s at all rational or sane.</p>
<p>What I don’t get is people conflating the kind of talk that goes with this, implicitly or explicitly calling people who voted “the wrong way” Nazis or the like, with their business identity. How anyone who is the public face for their business or product, like David or Joe, who want people to pay to attend their photography training events, or actors or singers who want the public to attend their concerts or plays or movies, can feel at ease alienating half the American public? I’m not inclined to take part in boycotts at the drop of the hat—I am inclined to do things like eat more often at Chick-fil-a or buy from L. L. Bean if they are being shamed and boycotted for expressing an entirely normal opinion or supporting one or the other side in an election. I’m just like that.</p>
<p>I’ll go back to The Strobist site and give him my pageviews, and buy from him anyway, but I don’t feel the same about doing it that I did before. I very well might buy a ticket to a movie that Meryl Streep is in (although I just might stay away from a movie that Ashley Judd is in after seeing her performance at the Womens’ March today) if it’s Really Special, but it’s going to have to be a Really Special one.</p>
<p>I may be the only person who feels this way, and if so, it won’t mean anything to anybody’s business. I couldn’t afford to attend David or Joe’s seminar in Dubai anyway, and I don’t go to very many movies at all, and I’m not part of Beyonce’s crew, or whatever, so they won’t feel the loss. But it seems like they really don’t care, and that’s what I don’t get.</p>
<h2 id="just-a-thought">Just a Thought</h2>
<p>Sun, 22 Jan 2017</p>
<p>Spent a minute looking through FaceBook, making sure that everyone I know who chose to exercise their freedom of assembly in the city today made it out okay, and posting a picture I took of my granddaughter Sophia playing her violin. It occurred to me how nice it is that so many people feel free to say really disrespectful, vulgar things about the President of the United States in a public setting without fear of being called “Racist” and possibly losing their jobs. Just a thought.</p>

<p>“It will be one of the confusions of the damned to see that they are condemned by their own reason, by which they claimed to condemn the Christian religion.”—Pascal, Pensée # 562.</p>
<p>“A new species of philosopher is appearing; I venture to baptize these philosophers with a name not without danger in it. As I divine them, as they let themselves be divined—for it pertains to their nature to want to remain a riddle in some respects—these philosophers of the future, in many respects, might rightly, but perhaps also wrongly, be described as attempters. This name itself is in the end only an attempt, and, if you will, a temptation.”—Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil, # 42.</p>

<h2 id="the-head-comes-loose">The Head Comes Loose…</h2>
<p>Mon, 13 Feb 2017</p>
<p>One character I think of—having known a long time—provides an especially poignant example. Long ago I suspected there was something wrong with him. He was “on my side,” but I could never trust him. And this because, he always thought ahead. “He has more brains than he can handle,” I once said of him. A very full head and a rather empty chest. He had no spiritual anchor, no faith beneath his clouds. His principles were mere thoughts: fluff passing over. Even his religious views were “solidly pragmatic,” i.e. easily revised. He could not understand even his own body, because he was all brain. His views were in a constant state of “evolution”: becoming ever more titched.</p>
<p>The head comes loose, when the heart is not screwed in.</p>

<p>Tue, 14 Feb 2017</p>
<p>Apropos all the recent fuss: 8 U.S.C. Â§ 1182(f), as currently posted by the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title8/html/USCODE-2011-title8-chap12-subchapII-partII-sec1182.htm">Government Printing Office</a> is the enabling statute (check it for yourself):</p>
<p>“(f) Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by President Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.”</p>
<p>This is what is called “black letter law” and to this High School Graduate seems pretty straightforward, but I’d be pleased to listen to any argument to the contrary that doesn’t smell like politics.</p>

<p>Wed, 15 Feb 2017</p>
<p>“There are people who strictly deprive themselves of each and every eatable, drinkable and smokeable which has in any way acquired a shady reputation. They pay this price for health. And health is all they get for it. How strange it is. It is like paying out your whole fortune for a cow that has gone dry.”—Mark Twain</p>
<p>“When they used to tell me I would shorten my life ten years by smoking, they little knew the devotee they were wasting their puerile word upon—they little knew how trivial and valueless I would regard a decade that had no smoking in it!”—Mark Twain</p>
<p>He is also known to have used Bad Words in his published works, which have been widely banned and declared Badthink. Memory hole material.</p>
<h2 id="beware">Beware!</h2>
<p>Wed, 15 Feb 2017</p>
<p>“Beware of manufacturing a God of your own, a God who is all mercy, but not just— a God who is all love, but not holy—a God who has a Heaven for everybody, but Hell for none—a God who can allow good and bad to be side by side in time, but will make no distinction between good and bad in eternity. Such a god is an idol of your own, as true an idol as was ever moulded out of brass or clay. The hands of your own fancy and sentimentality have made him. He is not the God of the Bible, and besides the God of the Bible there is no god at all.”—The Right Reverand John C. Ryles, Bishop of Liverpool (1880-1900)</p>

<h2 id="illegitimi-non-carborundum">Illegitimi non carborundum</h2>
<p>Fri, 17 Feb 2017</p>
<p>I’ve been gradually working my way through all of the Heinlein corpus, and a year or so back I ran across his list of “things every adult should know” and one that I wasn’t close on was a foreign language. I’m confident that my two years of High School Spanish wouldn’t cut the mustard. So, I chose Latin.</p>
<p>It’s been slow slogging, mainly due to distractions and inertia, but I’m making a little progress, so I thought that I should have been able to make more sense of “illegitimi non carborundum” than I did. “Illegitimi” and “non” were easy, but “carborundum” while familiar as a brand name didn’t appear in any form in any of the Latin dictionaries or word lists that I could find.</p>

<p>“And I dare say the first time you saw a man raised from the dead you might think so too.” He giggled unconvincingly behind the smiling mask. “Oh, it’s funny, isn’t it? It isn’t a case of miracles not happening—it’s just a case of people calling them something else. Can’t you see the doctors round the dead man? He isn’t breathing any more, his pulse has stopped, his heart’s not beating: he’s dead. The somebody gives him back his life, and they all—what’s the expression?—reserve their opinion. They won’t say it’s a miracle, because that’s a word they don’t like. Then it happens again and again perhaps—because God’s about on earth—and they say: these aren’t miracles, it is simply that we have enlarged our conception of what life is. Now we know you can be alive without pulse, breath, heart-beats. And they invent a new word to describe that state of life, and they say science has disproved a miracle.” He giggled again. ‘You can’t get round them.”"—Graham Greene <em>The Power and the Glory</em></p>

<p>Thu, 04 May 2017</p>
<p>“WHEREVER I go, my first object, if I wish to find out the truth, is to get hold of the Free Press in France as in England, and even in America. But I know that wherever I get hold of such an organ it will be very strongly coloured with the opinion, or even fanaticism, of some minority. The Free Press, as a whole, if you add it all up and cancel out one exaggerated statement against another, does give you a true view of the state of society in which you live. The Official Press to-day gives you an absurdly false one everywhere. What a caricature—and what a base, empty caricature—of England or France or Italy you get in the”Times," or the “Manchester Guardian,” the “Matin,” or the “Tribune”! No one of them is in any sense general—or really national."—Hilaire Belloc: <em>The Free Press</em>, XI, B.</p>

<p>Wed, 17 May 2017</p>
<p>More than half a century ago, while I was still a child, I recall hearing a number of older people offer the following explanation for the great disasters that had befallen Russia: Men have forgotten God; that’s why all this has happened.</p>
<p>Since then I have spent well-nigh fifty years working on the history of our Revolution; in the process I have read hundreds of books, collected hundreds of personal testimonies, and have already contributed eight volumes of my own toward the effort of clearing away the rubble left by that upheaval. But if I were asked today to formulate as concisely as possible the main cause of the ruinous Revolution that swallowed up some sixty million of our people, I could not put it more accurately than to repeat: Men have forgotten God; that’s why all this has happened.</p>
<p>What is more, the events of the Russian Revolution can only be understood now, at the end of the century, against the background of what has since occurred in the rest of the world. What emerges here is a process of universal significance. And if I were called upon to identify briefly the principal trait of the entire twentieth century, here too, I would be unable to find anything more precise and pithy than to repeat once again: Men have forgotten God.—<a href="http://www.roca.org/OA/36/36h.htm">Alexander Solzhenitsyn</a></p>

<p>Fri, 26 May 2017</p>
<p>“Do you wonder why the legacy media are such puzzled otherworldly twits? Why, for example, they had no idea what was happening in the recent election? Why they seem to know so very little about America or much of anything else?”Some thoughts from a guy who spent a career in the racket:</p>
<p>"Ask journalists when they were last in a truck stop on an Interstate, last in Boone, North Carolina or Barstow, California or any of thousands of such towns across the country. Ask whether they were in the military, whether they have ever talked to a cop or an ambulance crewman or a fireman. Ask whether they have a Mexican friend, when they last ate in a restaurant where a majority of the customers were black. Whether they know an enlisted man, or anyone in the armed services. Whether they have hitchhiked overnight, baited a hook, hunted, or fired a rifle. Whether they have ever worked washing dishes, harvesting crops, driving a delivery truck. Whether they have a blue-collar friend. Know what the Texas Two-Step is, have been in a biker bar.</p>

<p>“Journalists are not stupid, running to well above average in intelligence. You could form a large chapter of Mensa by raiding newsrooms in Washington. However, with a fair few exceptions, they are not intellectuals, not contemplative, not studious. They are high-pressure fact-accountants, competitive, comfortable under tight deadlines, aggressive, combative, quick but shallow.

I can only express the hope, and indeed the confidence, that those who regard me as the heretic will hardly blame me for expressing my own convictions, and certainly not for expressing my hero’s convictions. There is only one point upon which such a question concerns this very simple narrative. It is the conviction, which I have expressed once or twice in the course of it, that the sixteenth-century schism was really a belated revolt of the thirteenth-century pessimists. It was a back-wash of the old Augustinian Puritanism against the Aristotelian liberality. Without that, I could not place my historical figure in history.”—G. K.

<p>Sun, 11 Jun 2017</p>
<p>“There can be no doubt that there is an essential relation between Christian revelation and certain fundamental natural truths. The existence of objective truth, the spiritual reality of the person, the difference between soul and body, the objectivity of moral good and evil, the freedom of the will, the immortality of the soul, the existence of a personal God—all are implied by Christian revelation. Every word in the New Testament clearly presupposes these elementary truths.

<h2 id="the-pagan-ideal">The Pagan Ideal</h2>
<p>Sun, 25 Jun 2017</p>
<p>“My objection to Mr. Lowes Dickinson and the reassertors of the pagan ideal is, then, this. I accuse them of ignoring definite human discoveries in the moral world, discoveries as definite, though not as material, as the discovery of the circulation of the blood. We cannot go back to an ideal of reason and sanity. For mankind has discovered that reason does not lead to sanity. We cannot go back to an ideal of pride and enjoyment. For mankind has discovered that pride does not lead to enjoyment. I do not know by what extraordinary mental accident modern writers so constantly connect the idea of progress with the idea of independent thinking. Progress is obviously the antithesis of independent thinking. For under independent or individualistic thinking, every man starts at the beginning, and goes, in all probability, just as far as his father before him. But if there really be anything of the nature of progress, it must mean, above all things, the careful study and assumption of the whole of the past. I accuse Mr. Lowes Dickinson and his school of reaction in the only real sense. If he likes, let him ignore these great historic mysteries—the mystery of charity, the mystery of chivalry, the mystery of faith. If he likes, let him ignore the plough or the printing-press. But if we do revive and pursue the pagan ideal of a simple and rational self-completion we shall end—where Paganism ended. I do not mean that we shall end in destruction. I mean that we shall end in Christianity.”—G. K. Chesterton, <a href="https://www.ccel.org/ccel/chesterton/heretics.xii.html"><em>Heretics</em></a></p>

Those who are persuaded that the purpose of life is pleasure, or power, or honour, will reckon that State best arranged in which they can live comfortably, or acquire great wealth, or achieve great power and lord it over many. Others who think that the crowning good of virtue is the purpose of our present life will want an arrangement under which men can live virtuously and peaceably together.

<p>“To say that the present is a time of change and upheaval, social, political and religious, is to state a truism so obvious as to invite ironic contradiction. The cataclysm through which we are passing is at once so vast in its dimensions and so profound in its penetration of individual life, that we may well shrink from looking to history for guidance on circumstances to which history itself affords no parallel. Yet it is no new thing for the established manners, customs and beliefs of men to be upset. In all such times of violent transition the same great problem of the reconciliation between old and new forces itself upon the judgement of mankind, and it should not be impossible to find in the lesser crises of the past principles of thought and action which may help us to deal with the gigantic perplexities of today.”—Oliver Chase Quick, <em>Essays in Orthodoxy</em> 1916</p>

<p>“The riddle of life is simply this. For some mad reason in this mad world of ours, the things which men differ about most are exactly the things about which they must be got to agree. Men can agree on the fact that the earth goes round the sun. But then it does not matter a dump whether the earth goes around the sun or the Pleiades. But men cannot agree about morals: sex, property, individual rights, fixity and contracts, patriotism, suicide, public habits of health—these are exactly the things that men tend to fight about. And these are exactly the things that must be settled somehow on strict principles. Study each of them, and you will find each of them works back certainly to a philosophy, probably to a religion.”—G. K. Chesterton, <em>The Victorian Age</em></p>

<p>The Gods of the Copybook Headings</p>
<p>by Rudyard Kipling</p>
<p>AS I PASS through my incarnations in every age and race, I make my proper prostrations to the Gods of the Market Place. Peering through reverent fingers I watch them flourish and fall, And the Gods of the Copybook Headings, I notice, outlast them all.</p>
<p>We were living in trees when they met us. They showed us each in turn That Water would certainly wet us, as Fire would certainly burn: But we found them lacking in Uplift, Vision and Breadth of Mind, So we left them to teach the Gorillas while we followed the March of Mankind.</p>
<p>We moved as the Spirit listed. They never altered their pace, Being neither cloud nor wind-borne like the Gods of the Market Place, But they always caught up with our progress, and presently word would come That a tribe had been wiped off its icefield, or the lights had gone out in Rome.</p>
<p>With the Hopes that our World is built on they were utterly out of touch, They denied that the Moon was Stilton; they denied she was even Dutch; They denied that Wishes were Horses; they denied that a Pig had Wings; So we worshipped the Gods of the Market Who promised these beautiful things.</p>
<p>When the Cambrian measures were forming, They promised perpetual peace. They swore, if we gave them our weapons, that the wars of the tribes would cease. But when we disarmed They sold us and delivered us bound to our foe, And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: “<em>Stick to the Devil you know</em>.”</p>
<p>On the first Feminian Sandstones we were promised the Fuller Life (Which started by loving our neighbour and ended by loving his wife) Till our women had no more children and the men lost reason and faith, And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: “<em>The Wages of Sin is Death</em>.”</p>
<p>In the Carboniferous Epoch we were promised abundance for all, By robbing selected Peter to pay for collective Paul; But, though we had plenty of money, there was nothing our money could buy, And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: “<em>If you don’t work you die</em>.”</p>
<p>Then the Gods of the Market tumbled, and their smooth-tongued wizards withdrew And the hearts of the meanest were humbled and began to believe it was true That All is not Gold that Glitters, and Two and Two make Four And the Gods of the Copybook Headings limped up to explain it once more.</p>
<p>As it will be in the future, it was at the birth of Man There are only four things certain since Social Progress began. That the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her Mire, And the burnt Fool’s bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire;</p>
<p>And that after this is accomplished, and the brave new world begins When all men are paid for existing and no man must pay for his sins, As surely as Water will wet us, as surely as Fire will burn, The Gods of the Copybook Headings with terror and slaughter return!</p>

<p>“Why am I telling you all this? Because I fear that, except for a few of us remaining graybeards and some immigrants from the world’s manifold tyrannies and anarchies, most Americans are too young to remember, even vicariously, the ills that the world can inflict and the effort it takes to withstand and restrain them. They have studied no history, so not only can they not distinguish Napoleon from Hitler, but also they have no conception of how many ills mankind has suffered or inflicted on itself and how heroic has been the effort of the great, the wise, and the good over the centuries to advance the world’s enlightenment and civilization—efforts that the young have learned to scorn as the self-interested machinations of dead white men to maintain their dominance. While young people are examining their belly buttons for microaggressions, real evil still haunts the world, still inheres in human nature; and those who don’t know this are at risk of being ambushed and crushed by it.”—Myron Magnet in <a href="https://www.city-journal.org/html/see-no-evil-15330.html">The City Journal</a></p>

There is therefore a time in which peace is justified and a time when it is not justifiable. For it is written that there is a time for peace and a time for war and it is the law of truth that distinguishes the two. But at no time is there a time for truth and a time for error, for it is written that God’s truth shall abide forever. That is why Christ has said that He has come to bring peace and at the same time that He has come to bring the sword. But He does not say that He has come to bring both the truth and the falsehood.”—Blaise Pascal</p>

Never mind that in accusing us of judging, the worldly-minded are themselves doing the very judging they condemn. Never mind any of that; the point of the charge is to try to shame us into silence. Despite the fact that Scripture consistently directs us to correct the sinner, many Catholics have bought into the notion that correcting the sinner is “judging” him. In this, the devil, who orchestrates the “correcting is judging” campaign, rejoices; for if he can keep us from correcting one another, sin can and does flourish."—<a href="http://blog.adw.org/2017/09/obligation-clear-compassionate-correction-sinner-homily-23rd-sunday-year/">Msgr.

In our case it is largely commerce and the ideals and ideas that commerce fosters. Moreover, the liberty that accompanies such a commercial society is a liberty whose chief effect is the dissolving of traditional ties and the destruction of traditional communities, whether that takes place because of direct attacks on the family and chastity or indirectly because of an economic system that works as a solvent in hundreds of ways: driving mothers out of the home, exploiting sex to sell products, moving families about to seek employment, or emptying rural areas of farm families.”—<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EJ0OQ92/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1">Thomas Storck</a></p>

<p>Fri, 22 Sep 2017</p>
<p>‘Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others ; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness: only power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from all the oligarchies of the past, in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now do you begin to understand me?”—George Orwell—<em>1984</em> O’Brien to Winston</p>

<p>Fri, 13 Oct 2017</p>
<p>“Heresy and schism are distinguished in respect of those things to which each is opposed essentially and directly. For heresy is essentially opposed to faith, while schism is essentially opposed to the unity of ecclesiastical charity. Wherefore just as faith and charity are different virtues, although whoever lacks faith lacks charity, so too schism and heresy are different vices, although whoever is a heretic is also a schismatic, but not conversely. This is what Jerome says in his commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians [In Ep. ad Tit. iii, 10]:”I consider the difference between schism and heresy to be that heresy holds false doctrine while schism severs a man from the Church." Nevertheless, just as the loss of charity is the road to the loss of faith, according to 1 Timothy 1:6: “From which things,” i.e. charity and the like, “some going astray, are turned aside into vain babbling,” so too, schism is the road to heresy. Wherefore Jerome adds (In Ep. ad Tit. iii, 10) that “at the outset it is possible, in a certain respect, to find a difference between schism and heresy: yet there is no schism that does not devise some heresy for itself, that it may appear to have had a reason for separating from the Church.”—St. Thomas Aquinas: <a href="http://newadvent.org/summa/3039.htm"><em>Summa Theologica</em></a>, II-II, q. 39, a. 1, ad 3</p>

The less the true historical book is read and the more men depend upon ephemeral statement, the more will legend crystallize, the harder will it be to destroy in the general mind some comforting lie, and the great object-lesson of politics (which is an accurate knowledge of how men have acted in the past) will become at last unknown." — Hilaire Belloc: <a href="https://oldthunderbelloc.blogspot.com/2014/02/on-decline-of-book.html"><em>On the Decline of the Book</em></a></p>

There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.”—G. K. Chesterton, <em>The Drift from Domesticity</em></p>
<h2 id="the-task-of-redemption">The Task of Redemption</h2>
<p>Thu, 09 Nov 2017</p>
<p>St. John Paul II describes how Christ’s act of redeeming us from slavery to sin is both a free gift and a task:</p>
<p>“In the mystery of Redemption, Christ’s victory over evil is given to us not simply for our personal advantage, but also as a task. We accept that task as we set out upon the way of the interior life, working consciously on ourselves—with Christ as our Teacher. The Gospel calls us to follow this very path. Christ’s call”Follow me!" is echoed on many pages of the Gospel and is addressed to different people—not only to the Galilean fishermen whom Jesus calls to become his Apostles (cf. Mt 4:19, Jn 1:43), but also, for example, to the rich young man in the Synoptic Gospels (cf. Mt 19:16-22, Mk 10:17:22, Lk 18:18-23). Jesus’s conversation with him is one of the key texts to which we must constantly return, from various points of view, as I did, for example, in the encyclical Veritatis Splendor.</p>
<p>“The call”Follow me!" is an invitation to set out along the path to which the inner dynamic of the mystery of Redemption leads us. This is the path indicated by the teaching, so often found in writings on the interior life and on mystical experience, about the three stages involved in “following Christ.” These three stages are sometimes called “ways.” We speak of the purgative way, the illuminative way, and the unitive way. In reality, these are not three distinct ways, but three aspects of the same way, along which Christ calls everyone, as he once called that young man in the Gospel.</p>
<p>“When the young man asks:”Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?“, Christ answers him:”If you wish to enter life, keep the commandments" (Mt 19:16 et passim). And when the young man continues to ask: “Which?” Christ simply reminds him of the principal commandments of the Decalogue, and especially those from the so-called “second tablet” concerning relations with one’s neighbor. In Christ’s teaching, of course, all the commandments are summarized in the commandment to love God above all things and one’s neighbor as oneself. He says so explicitly to a doctor of the Law in response to a question (cf. Mt 22:34-40; Mk 12:28-31). Observance of the commandments, properly understood, is synonymous with the purgative way: it means conquering sin, moral evil in its various guises. And this leads to a gradual inner purification.</p>
<p>“It also enables us to discover values. And hence we conclude that the purgative way leads organically into the illuminative way. Values are lights which illumine existence and, as we work on our lives, they shine ever more brightly on the horizon. So side by side with observance of the commandments—which has an essentially purgative meaning—we develop virtues. For example, in observing the commandment:”Thou shall not kill!" we discover the value of life under various aspects and we learn an ever deeper respect for it. In observing the commandment: “Thou shall not commit adultery!” we acquire the virtue of purity, and this means that we come to an ever greater awareness of the gratuitous beauty of the human body, of masculinity and femininity. This gratuitous beauty becomes a light for our actions. In observing the commandment: “Thou shall not bear false witness!” we learn the virtue of truthfulness. This not only excludes all lying and hypocrisy from our lives, but it develops within us a kind of “instinct for truth” which guides all our actions. And living thus in the truth, we acquire in our own humanity a connatural truthfulness.</p>
<p>“So the illuminative stage in the interior life emerges gradually from the purgative stage. With the passage of time, if we persevere in following Christ our Teacher, we feel less and less burdened by the struggle against sin, and we enjoy more and more the divine light which pervades all creation. This is most important, because it allows us to escape from a situation of constant inner exposure to the risk of sin—even though, on this earth, the risk always remains present to some degree—so as to move with ever greater freedom within the whole of the created world. The same freedom and simplicity characterizes our relations with other human beings, including those of the opposite sex. Interior light illumines our actions and shows us all the good in the created world as coming from the hand of God. Thus the purgative way and then the illuminative way form the organic introduction to what is known as the unitive way. This is the final stage of the interior journey, when the soul experiences a special union with God. This union is realized in contemplation of the divine Being and in the experience of love which flows from it with growing intensity. In this way we somehow anticipate what is destined to be ours in eternity, beyond death and the grave. Christ, supreme Teacher of the spiritual life, together with all those who have been formed in his school, teaches that even in this life we can enter onto the path of union with God.” — St. John Paul II – <em>Memory and Identity</em> Rizzoli 2005:</p>

But from yourself, from your sense of failure, your weakness, your shortcomings, whether can you flee? Only to the eternal God, your refuge, until the immensity of His spirit envelopes your spirit and it loses its smallness and weakness and comes into harmony again with His.</p>

<p>“Woe to the path that is not walked on, or along which the voices of men are not heard, for then it becomes the haunt of wild animals. Woe to the soul if the Lord does not walk within it to banish with his voice the spiritual beasts of sin. Woe to the house where no master dwells, to the field where no farmer works, to the pilotless ship, storm-tossed and sinking. Woe to the soul without Christ as its true pilot; drifting in the darkness, buffeted by the waves of passion, storm-tossed at the mercy of evil spirits, its end is destruction. Woe to the soul that does not have Christ to cultivate it with care to produce the good fruit of the Holy Spirit. Left to itself, it is choked with thorns and thistles; instead of fruit it produces only what is fit for burning.

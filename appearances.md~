# INTRODUCTION

There may be times when what is most needed is, not so much a new discovery or a new idea as a different &lsquo;slant&rsquo; I mean a comparatively slight readjustment in our way of looking at the things and ideas on which attention is already fixed.

Draw a rectangular glass box in perspective&mdash;not too precise perspective (for the receding lines must be kept parallel, instead of converging)&mdash;and look at it. It has a front and a back, a top and a bottom. But slide your hand across it in the required direction and look again: you may find that what you thought was the inside of the top has become its outside, while th eoutside of the front wall has changed to the inside of the back wall, and vice versa. The visual readjustment was slight, for the box has not only turned inside out but is also lying at quite a different angle.
